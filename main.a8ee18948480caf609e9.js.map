Begins with the information on \"Imipolex G\" that Slothrop\n                has gotten (<i>via </i>Bounce's teletype) from London. It is a plastic developed\n                in 1939 for I.G.\n                Farben by, of course,\n                Laszlo Jamf. We learn \"Plasticity's central canon: that chemists were no\n                longer at the mercy of\n                Nature.\" (249: cf. Walter Rathenau, 166; also Slothrop's Plasticman comic,\n                206-7?) A brief\n                history of the development of plastics, into increasingly complex molecular\n                chains, is paralleled\n                by a brief history of the development of interlocking \"arrangements\" among\n                the corporations that\n                manufacture them. (250-51) Slothrop fantasizes a commando raid on Duncan\n                Sandys' office at\n                Shell Mex House, London; at the heart of it all he finds only machines, talking\n                to one another.\n                Returned from fantasy (?), he finds a new clue on the parts list:\n                \"S-Ger&auml;t, 11/00000\"--apparently\n                the serial number of a special model rocket, using Imipolex G, somehow, for\n                insulation.\n            </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Slothrop comes upon (by chance?) a copy (forged?) of the London\n                <i>Times</i>, containing an obituary,\n                by Bloat, for Tantivy, supposedly killed in heroic action. He flees to Nice\n                (as, we learn later, he\n                was supposed to), going to the address on Waxwing's card. During the night\n                he is visited by\n                various dead and/or departed. Next day, Waxwing's agents give him new papers,\n                a new name\n                (Ian Scuffling), and an address in Z&uuml;rich. He arrives a week later,\n                and contacts Waxwing's\n                representative, Semyavin. He meets (in a musical \"number\") various \"Loonies\n                on Leave!\" (259-60) Looking for sources of information in information-specific\n                caf&eacute;s, he meets Mario Schweitar,\n                who tells him of Jamf's death.\n            </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Schweitar offers more information for a price, but Slothrop is broke.\n                        And seeing a strange Rolls\n                        Royce in front of his hotel, Slothrop recognizes that he cannot return, that\n                        he is also homeless.\n                        Proverb #4 (262).

Why <i>Germany</i>? Squalidozzi on Argentine history: \"We are\n                obsessed with building\n                labyrinths, where before there was open plain and sky. . . .

May: A \"White Visitation\" picnic by the sea (cf. opening\n                        of part 2?). Pointsman\n                        thinks about the disappearance of Slothrop, lost by British Intelligence\n                        a month ago, in Z&uuml;rich.\n                        He thinks, as well, about his major blunder: authorizing Harvey Speed and\n                        Floyd Perdoo to\n                        investigate Slothrop's sexual adventures in London, the ones recorded on\n                        the map (this operation\n                        being known, acronimically, as SEZ WHO). Unfortunately there is no evidence\n                        that any of his\n                \"scores\"-- not even Darlene (though there <i>is </i>a \"Mrs. Quoad\")--actually\n                existed. The War over,\n                Pointsman must confront efforts to dissolve PISCES (as well as more general\n                tendencies to\n                dissolve the stark polarities sustained by the War). He has begun to feel\n                \"the solitude of a\n                F&uuml;hrer.\" Back to the sea-side, we get our first allusion to the Rossini\n                vs. Beethoven controversy--which, we're told (presumably, here, by the narrator),\n                will later erupt in Berlin. Pointsman,\n                facing his various dissolutions, begins to act \"a bit mental\"--he's hearing\n                a Voice. We learn, as\n                those at \"The White Visitation\" have recently learned, that there really\n                <i>is</i> a \"Schwarzkommando\"\n                operating in Germany, just as in the \"fiction\" created by Operation Blackwing.\n                All this following\n                a digression on <i>King Kong</i>.

Early morning (cf. dawn openings of parts 1 and 2?): Slothrop\n                        arrives at\n                        Nordhausen. He recalls meeting his first African (Enzian), and Major Duane\n                        Marvy. The \"plot\"\n                        [which will thicken, then, strangely, thin]: Schweitar's information on\n                Imipolex G (see <a onClick={handleClick} href=\"#2-7\">2: [7]</a>\n                above) points to Franz P&ouml;kler (see\n                <a onClick={handleClick} href=\"#1-18\">1: [18]</a> and <a onClick={handleClick} href=\"#1-19\">[19]</a> above), who came\n                to the Mittelwerke, an\n                underground rocket factory at Nordhausen, in 1944. The Shell file on Jamf\n                points to Lyle Bland\n                of Boston, to Hugo Stinnes (a German financier), and to a banknote contract\n                with the Slothrop\n                Paper Company. All this recalls to Slothrop a smell (\"<i>the breath of the\n                    Forbidden Wing</i>\"\n                [presumably Imipolex G, involved in Jamf's experiments on \"Infant Tyrone\"]);\n                it also produces\n                an erection.

From\n                all this Slothrop concludes that his father Broderick (\"B.S.\") \"sold\" him\n                to Bland, for Jamf's\n                experiments, in return for money for Slothrop's education; and Slothrop's\n                apparently been under\n                surveillance ever since.\n            </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Slothrop--travelling in the Zone as a British journalist, Ian Scuffling--also\n                        recalls Marvy, on top\n                        of a moving railroad car, warning him about \"niggers\" in the next car, Southwest\n                        African rocket\n                        troops (the Scwarzkommando), who have now joined together, heading for\n                        Nordhausen.

Moving deeper into the tunnel Slothrop\n                hears our\n                first rocket limericks (305-7), sung at a drunken Russian-American party,\n                which he soon joins.

We learn about Galina, \"the schoolmarm,\"\n                and about Dzaqyp\n                Qulan, the \"native\" schoolteacher, whose father was killed in the Kirghiz\n                massacre of 1916 (cf.\n                Fran van der Groov and the Dodoes, <a onClick={handleClick} href=\"#1-14\">1: [14]</a> above? the Herero massacre, <a\n                            href=\"#1-14\">1: [14]</a>\n                above? the\n                attitude toward Indians implied by all the Western lingo here? Vietnam?).\n                We learn, too, about\n                Tchitcherine's horse, Snake, from the United States. There are various rumors\n                (this flashback,\n                like many in the book, is shifting into the present tense) about the reasons\n                for Tchitcherine's\n                banishment to Central Asia: an alliance with a \"Soviet Courtesan\"; an\n                acquaintance with\n                Wimpe, a German salesman for IG, with a special interest in \"opium alkaloids\n                and their many\n                variations.\" Cut from this to the Chinese swamper, Chu Piang, with whom\n                Tchitcherine smokes\n                opium. Then we hear Wimpe discourse on Morphine research, on Laszlo Jamf\n                (348). Or has\n                Tchitcherine (as <i>he </i>thinks) been banished to Kirghiz (and Chekovian\n                longing for return to the\n                city) because of Enzian? We learn how Tchitcherine's sailor-father fled\n                the horror of loading\n                coal in a Southwest African port (\"a conspiracy of carbon . . . he could\n                smell Death in it\") to the\n                \"honest blackness\" of Enzian's mother (351). We then learn, in chaotic detail,\n                about factional\n                infighting at the NTA plenary session, and about the similarity of its committees\n                to Soviet\n                \"Committees on molecular structure.\" (355) Tchitcherine and Dzaqyp Qulan\n                ride into a village\n                in time to hear a singing duel (cf. 387?)--and to hear an old aqyn (wandering\n                singer) sing (we're\n                into the Oral Tradition here, no writing) about seeing the \"Kirghiz Light/In\n                a place where words\n                are unknown.\" Following his instructions the Russian and his sidekick travel\n                to It, but Tchitcherine's \"heart was never ready.\" \"But in the Zone . .\n                . the Rocket is waiting.

Slothrop lies sick (he drank the water!) in a Berlin basement.\n                        He recalls his\n                        second encounter with Enzian; the Schwarzkommando were dredging for pieces\n                        of rocket. He\n                        sees their symbol. Their disappointment at the serial number on what they\n                        dredge up reveals that\n                        they, too, are looking for the 00000 rocket. Enzian tells him the Herero\n                        mantra (since the\n                        massacre): \"'Mba-kayere . . . 'I am passed over.'\" Back in the basement,\n                        Slothrop considers his\n                        own quest: \"The Schwarzger&auml;t is no Grail, Ace.\" (364) He \"will meet,\"\n                        we're told, Greta\n                        Erdmann, a former movie actress. \"This is how they meet,\" we're told. Then\n                        we're told of\n                        Slothrop's meeting with Emil (\"S&auml;ure\" [\"acid\"]) Bummer, notorious cat\n                        burglar and doper, whose\n                        girls give Slothrop a Wagnerian opera costume (cape, helmet), transforming\n                        him into\n                        \"Raketemensch\" (Rocketman). They all proceed to the Chicago Bar, a dopers'\n                        hangout,\n                        decorated with photos of John Dillinger. A song, \"The Doper's Dream\" (369),\n                        is sung by Seaman\n                        Bodine (known as \"Pig\" Bodine in V). Slothrop, now as Rocketman,\n                        is asked to go to Potsdam\n                        (where the Allied conference to work out the division of Germany is now taking\n                        place) to\n                        retrieve six kilos of hashish Bodine has buried there. For one of the kilos,\n                        and a million\n                        counterfeit marks printed by Bummer, he agrees. (NB. We're still waiting\n                        to find out just how\n                        Slothrop meets Greta Erdmann.)\n            </p>\n                    <p id=\"3-7\">\n                        [7] 371-383. Next morning, Bummer explains that the hash is buried across\n                        from Potsdam, \"in\n                        Neubabelsberg, the old movie capital of Germany.\" Slothrop learns of the\n                        death of \"his\n                        president,\" Roosevelt. (373) At mention of Schwarzger&auml;t, Bummer suggests\n                        that Slothrop talk to\n                        \"Der Springer.\" Now alone, with papers identifying him as \"Max Schlepzig,\"\n                        Slothrop heads for\n                        Potsdam. His boots (Tchitcherine's, given to him by Geli) lead to interrogation\n                        by Russians, but\n                        they finally let him pass (it turns out, though, that they've been in touch\n                        with Tchitcherine). He\n                        arrives at his destination, only to discover that during the Conference it's\n                        serving as Truman's\n                        residence. Digging up the hash beneath a balcony, he is suddenly staring\n                        face-to-face at Mickey\n                        Rooney (who, we're assured, will repress all memory of the encounter). Then,\n                        leaving, he is\n                        captured: \"You were followed all the way.\"\n            </p>\n                    <p id=\"3-8\">\n                        [8] 383-390. Cut to the hijacked U-boat of the Argentine anarchists\n                (see <a onClick={handleClick} href=\"#2-7\">2: [7]</a> above,\n                Squalidozzi--remember?). We learn the story behind Squalidozzi's disappearance\n                from Z&uuml;rich.\n                He was pursued by British Military Intelligence (Slothrop's Rolls Royce).\n                He came upon a group\n                of zoot-suited gangsters, Blodgett Waxwing's people, watching a Bob Steele\n                Western in an\n                abandoned harmonica factory, and meets Gerhardt von G&ouml;ll (\"Der Springer\"),\n                a German\n                filmmaker (who made the Schwarzkommando film for Operation Blackwing--see\n                <a onClick={handleClick} href=\"#1-14\">1: [14]</a>\n                above). He now offers to make a film of <i>Martin Fierro</i>, an epic\n                whose gaucho hero is regarded\n                by the anarchists as a saint. This has now become the major project of the\n                U-boat anarchists, but\n                there is a problem: will they shoot only part one, or will they also do\n                part two, in which the hero\n                sells out? There is a fantasy of a scene from the (as yet unmade) film:\n                Fierro's withdrawal from\n                General Roca's attempt to exterminate the pampa Indians (cf. all the other\n                genocidal massacres\n                thus far: Dodoes, Hereros, Central Asian \"natives\"?). We learn about von\n                G&ouml;ll's connections\n                with IG Farben, with Laszlo Jamf, about his best known film, the \"immortal\n                Alpdr&uuml;cken.\" His\n                interest in <i>Martin Fierro </i>stems mainly from the chance it offers\n                to shoot a scene of a singing duel\n                (387--cf. 3: [5] above?). The plan, then: to get to the L&uuml;neberg\n                Heath, meet von G&ouml;ll (who will\n                arrive separately), and shoot the movie there. The U-boat fires a torpedo\n                at the U.S.S. <i>John E. Badass </i>(Seaman Bodine's ship); but it misses,\n                apparently because Bodine\n                has added Oneirine\n                (\"Laszlo Jamf's celebrated intoxicant\") to the coffee.\n            </p>\n                    <p id=\"3-9\">\n                        [9] 390-392. Tchitcherine (it was he who captured Slothrop at Potsdam)\n                        has released him, after\n                        taking some hash for himself--which he is now smoking with a companion, getting\n                        more and\n                        more stoned. He put Slothrop, whom he likes, through a Sodium Amytal session:\n                        \"Black runs\n                        all through the transcript.\" He finds Slothrop's lone pursuit of the 00000\n                        rocket curious, and\n                        plans to have him followed.\n            </p>\n                    <p id=\"3-10\">\n                        [10] 392-397. Coming off Sodium Amytal, Slothrop dreams of being little\n                        and worried about\n                        little birds in a storm, being reassured by his father: \"Don't worry, son\"\n                        (cf.

Slothrop leaves the white room in which he has been\n                        interrogated (after\n                        noting that some of the hash has been taken) to find himself in an abandoned\n                        movie set, where he\n                meets (at last--see <a onClick={handleClick} href=\"#3-6\">3: [6] above</a>) Margherita (Greta) Erdmann, the movie\n                actress, who is looking\n                for her lost daughter, Bianca. They come to the set of von G&ouml;ll's\n                <i>Alpdr&uuml;cken</i>, in which she (as\n                victim) played opposite Max Schlepzig (as torturer), and during the filming\n                of which, she\n                believes, Bianca was conceived. Slothrop is bothered by the coincidence\n                (?) of names--his\n                papers identify <i>him</i>, after all, as \"Max Schlepzig\" (and the handwriting\n                on the pass, Greta claims,\n                is that of the \"real\" Max). Anyway, Slothrop and Greta act out the scene\n                from <i>Alpdr&uuml;cken</i> (on\n                the set of <i>Alpdr&uuml;cken</i>), Slothrop as \"Schlepzig,\" Greta as \"Greta\":\n                bondage, whipping, sex.

It was his arousal\n                from seeing\n                <i>Alpdr&uuml;cken</i> that inspired the conception of Franz and Leni's\n                daughter, Ilse (cf.

He recalls his fear of the\n                political demonstrations\n                (the street) to which he lost Leni; he recalls an argument they had over\n                the meaning of the\n                Rocket, which he has come in his way (and out of his fear) to worship (400).\n                He turned to the\n                Rocket, in earnest, to pull himself together after Leni left him. He recalls\n                the \"electro-mysticism\"\n                of Kurt Mondaugen (see <a onClick={handleClick} href=\"#1-19\">1: [19]</a> above). His memories of early rocket days\n                also include\n                Weissmann (Blicero) and Enzian. He moved to Peenem&uuml;nde (where rockets\n                were tested) in\n                1937, but he couldn't quite forget his old Berlin self; he was torn between\n                \"personal identity and\n                impersonal salvation.\" (406) We learn of the connection linking the Rocket,\n                film, and calculus\n                (407). Then, one summer, \"Ilse\" appeared at his cubicle, for a visit, reporting\n                that she and Leni\n                were living at an SS \"reeducation\" camp. P&ouml;kler dreamed about the history\n                of Friedrich August\n                Kekul&eacute;, father of organic chemistry (410-13), and about Kekul&eacute;'s\n                dream: a serpent with its tail in\n                its mouth. We learn how this dream was misused by the System, as the foundation\n                for\n                understanding the benzine ring. All this is lectured on by \"P&ouml;kler's\n                old prof,\" Laszlo Jamf. Ilse's\n                fantasy was to live on the moon. Then one evening, returning from work,\n                P&ouml;kler found her gone.\n                He was crushed: \"Victim in a Vacuum,\" song (414-15). Mondaugen advised\n                that he wait, rather\n                than rebel; and P&ouml;kler agreed.<br /><br />As war approached P&ouml;kler\n                became more enmeshed in the life of the\n                Rocket (his life is often\n                recalled, indeed, in terms appropriate to the rocket's flight). \"It is the\n                grim phoenix,\" we are told,\n                \"which creates its own holocaust . . . delibeate <i>resurrection</i>.\n                . . the planet of National\n                Socialism.\" (415) The next summer, again apparently arranged by Weissmann,\n                there was another\n                visit from \"Ilse\" (as before, he could not be certain it was she). This\n                time he was granted a two-week furlough; they went to Zw&ouml;lfkinder, whose\n                exhibits recapitulate many motifs from earlier\n                portions of <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i>. P&ouml;kler fantasized incest and\n                escape (420-21), but instead\n                accepted \"Ilse\" as his daughter: \"It was the real moment of conception,\n                in which, years too late,\n                he became her father.\" (421) Then, the two weeks over, she disappeared again.\n                And \"so it has\n                gone for the six years since,\" his need of her used by Weissmann (cf.\n                Pointsman/Pudding/Katje,\n                <a onClick={handleClick} href=\"#2-4\">2: [4]</a> above?) to keep P&ouml;kler in line. He compares her regularly repeated\n                appearances to the\n                regular repetition of frames in film: she is \"the moving image of a daughter.\"\n                (422)\n            </p>\n                    <p>\n                        He was transferred, in 1944, to Nordhausen, where he dreamed about a light\n                        bulb (426-27: cf.\n                \"The Story of Byron the Bulb,\" <a onClick={handleClick} href=\"#4-3\">4: [3]</a> below?). He became increasingly aware\n                of the\n                concentration camp, Dora, next to Nordhausen. Which, he learned, was where\n                \"Ilse\" was\n                imprisoned. Then Weissmann, whom P&ouml;kler had not seen since leaving\n                Peenem&uuml;nde (though he\n                had heard rumors of a break with Enzian), appeared to get P&ouml;kler to\n                work on modifications for a\n                special rocket, the 00000. His job was to produce an insulated plastic fairing,\n                to contain\n                something called a \"Schwarzger&auml;t.\" He never saw Weissmann again; but\n                his reward for this\n                special work (apparently) was a letter from Weissmann, promising that \"Ilse\"\n                would be freed,\n                that she would meet him at Zw&ouml;lfkinder (which is why he is there \"now,\"\n                waiting for her). With\n                defeat approaching, and the Mittelwerke being evacuated, he finally got into\n                Dora, next door. He\n                was appalled at what he saw: endless stacks of bodies, the others near death,\n                emaciated, starving.\n                Onto the finger of \"a woman lying, a random woman,\" he slipped his gold wedding\n                ring.\n            </p>\n                    <p id=\"3-12\">\n                        [12] 433-447.

Der Springer, after discussing the relationship of \"elite\n                and preterite,\" sings \"Bright\n                Days (Fox-Trot)\" (495).

Listening to Marvy and Chicklitz talk, Tchitcherine\n                        (like Enzian--\n                see <a onClick={handleClick} href=\"#3-21\">3: [21]</a> above) begins to suspect a conspiracy: \"<i>A Rocket-cartel\n                </i>transcending national\n                boundaries, a \"Rocket-state whose borders he cannot cross.\" (566)\n            </p>\n                    <p id=\"3-28\">\n                        [28] 566-577.

Later, the police brutally break up the village's\n                        black market (cf. the\n                death of Peter Sachsa?--see <a onClick={handleClick} href=\"#1-18\">1: [18]</a> and <a onClick={handleClick} href=\"#1-19\">[19]</a>\n                        <a onClick={handleClick} href=\"#2-3\">2: [3]</a> above). Slothrop is\n                rescued from the ensuing\n                riot by a girl with whom he hides (cf.

(The story of Lyle Bland and the Masons.) We learn about\n                        Bland's \"nefarious\n                        tricks,\" including covert encouragement of \"genital obsession\" among workers.\n                        His business\n                        downfall began when he befriended Alfonso Tracy, Princeton '06, who had been\n                        stuck by the\n                        Chicago mob with a consignment of wildly messed-up pinball machines. Visiting\n                        the Masonic\n                        Temple at Mouthorgan, Mo., to see the machines, Bland then calls in his German\n                        \"expert,\" Bert\n                        Fibel--who works for General Electric in Pittsfield, Mass., as Bland's agent\n                        (to keep an eye on\n                        local boy, Tyrone Slothrop). Fibel fixes the machines, which is how Bland\n                        joined the Masons;\n                        they gave him membership out of gratitude. We then learn something of the\n                        history of the\n                        Masons, as a conspiratorial force behind much of American History (587-8).\n                        They have now lost\n                        touch with their former magic, becoming simply a businessman's club, but\n                        Bland gets in touch\n                        with the old magic. He learns to leave his body. He took to leaving it\n                        for longer and longer\n                        periods. Getting into it he finds \"that Gravity, taken so for granted, is\n                        really something eerie,\n                        Messianic, extrasensory in Earth's mindbody\" (590; his mysticism is compared\n                        to that reported\n                by the late Walter Rathenau to Carroll Eventyr--see <a onClick={handleClick} href=\"#1-19\">1: [19]</a> above).

Doctors Muffage and Spontoon are in Cuxhaven. They're\n                        working for\n                Pointsman--who, Muffage thinks, is \"<i>losing his grip</i>.\" And they're\n                looking for Slothrop--who,\n                they learn from a British corporal, is in town, wearing a pig suit. At an\n                alcohol dump, the fuel\n                now fuelling a party, Seaman Bodine (see <a onClick={handleClick} href=\"#3-6\">3: [6]</a> and <a onClick={handleClick} href=\"#3-8\">[8]</a> above)\n                is promoting a runciple spoon\n                fight. Slothrop's nearby, in a trailer, still wearing his pig suit. As\n                the police close in he escapes\n                with one Albert Krypton. They find Bodine who--the runciple spoon fight\n                over--flees with them,\n                the MP's (and Muffage and Spontoon) in hot pursuit. They hijack a Red Cross\n                canteen truck,\n                which takes them to a bar-casino-opium den-whorehouse, \"Putzi's,\" where Slothrop\n                hopes to\n                meet up with Der Springer. Bodine introduces Slothrop to a whore named\n                \"Solange,\" who offers\n                to take him to the baths. She explains to a by now very paranoid Slothrop\n                that the Zone is not\n                one Plot but, as he reflects, \"a network of all plots,\" which \"may yet carry\n                him to freedom.\" (603)\n                As they head for the baths Bodine goes off to make a cocaine delivery--to,\n                as it turns out, Major\n                Marvy. Marvy then gets set up with a Spanish whore (a victim of Franco),\n                Manuela, who hangs\n                his uniform in a closet and leads him to the baths. An MP raid is suddenly\n                announced; Marvy,\n                fleeing, finds only Slothrop's pig costume in the changing room. He puts\n                it on, and is then\n                captured. He is taken off in an ambulance, in which Muffage and\n                Spontoon--thinking he's\n                Slothrop--remove his testicles, for Pointsman. Marvy, too, as \"Slothrop,\"\n                is to be taken back to\n                Pointsman.\n            </p>\n                    <p>\n                        Meanwhile, back at Putzi's, Slothrop is asleep in bed with Solange, dreaming\n                        of Zw&ouml;lfkinder and\n                        Bianca. \"Solange,\" who is in fact Leni P&ouml;kler, is also dreaming--of\n                <i>her </i>Bianca, Ilse. \"Leni's\n                early dream for her is coming true.

Tchitcherine has traced Weissmann's rocket battery to\n                        the L&uuml;neberg Heath; but\n                what he has found there is the set of <i>Martin Fierro </i>(see <a onClick={handleClick} href=\"#3-8\">3: [8]</a>\n                above), which he's never read.\n                But the singing-duel is now being filmed, and he recognizes its similarity\n                to the one he saw in\n                Central Asia, on the way to the Kirghiz Light. He knows that Weissmann in\n                fact fired the 00000\n                rocket nearby. But now he must wait; \"there is a counterforce,\" he believes,\n                \"in the Zone.\" He\n                hopes he might meet Enzian here. Felipe--one of the Argentine anarchists\n                involved in the\n                filming of <i>Martin Fierro</i>--meditates (in the cinematic terms that\n                have become popular in the\n                group) on the true nature of history (612-13). This set, we learn, will\n                remain as a permanent\n                village. And we learn about new, strange villages springing up in the Zone,\n                including the Hund-Stadt, populated by trained killer-dogs who, since their\n                masters have died or disappeared, cannot\n                be pacified. A study on how to induce factionalism (master-cults) among\n                these dogs, in order to\n                facilitate the re-taking of the village, has been contracted to Pointsman.\n                He is now in official\n                disgrace, since the castrating of Marvy.

Sir Marcus's \"idle and bitchy faggotry\" is contrasted with the\n                loving homosexuality of\n                the World War I battlefields (cf.

An overhead bulb\n                        is kept lighted by a hand\n                        generator, cranked by Paddy (\"Electro\") McGonigle, an expert reader of strobing\n                        frequencies.\n                        They hear somebody \"playing blues on a mouth harp\" in the dark (624; another\n                        Slothropian\n                \"appearance\"?).

Which brings us to\n                \"The Story of Byron the Bulb\"\n                (647-55), told to \"Skippy\" by \"Mister Information.\" Byron's early dreams\n                of power set him\n                against \"Phoebus\"--the agency of the international light-bulb cartel which\n                \"fixes the prices and\n                determines the operational lives of all the bulbs in the world.\" After 1000\n                hours, with a Phoebus\n                hit-woman on her way to get him, Byron is bulb-snatched, and dispatched on\n                a series of travels\n                too bizarre to detail here.

He was\n                rescued by a Polish\n                undertaker, trying (in order to make him better in his particular line of\n                work) to get struck by\n                lightning--seeking to \"experience a singular point.\" After setting Thanatz\n                ashore, he gets his\n                wish (664-65). Thanatz then encounters a village of male homosexuals, liberated\n                (or, as they see\n                it, \"banished\") from Dora (see <a onClick={handleClick} href=\"#3-11\">3: [11]</a> above).

He seeks\n                him out, however, at a\n                nearby gasworks--recalling, meanwhile, Peter Sachsa's prewar s&eacute;ances\n                (668; see <a onClick={handleClick} href=\"#1-5\">1: [5]</a> <a onClick={handleClick} href=\"#1-18\">[18]</a> and\n                <a onClick={handleClick} href=\"#1-19\">[19]</a> above).

He travels the Zone as a DP.\n                His memory of the last\n                rocket-firing grows clearer--which he is now (i.e., in the \"present\" of the\n                close of the previous\n                chapter) relating to the Schwarzkommando.

We learn the\n                        story of \"the kid who hates kreplach\" (737).
