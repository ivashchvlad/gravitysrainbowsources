(198) Hearing his clothes being stolen he chases the thief and, after various adventures, finds his own room empty (even of identity cards). Tantivy, too, is gone. Paranoia is on the rise: "\'Fuck you,\' whispers Slothrop," to Them. He imagines the 1630 Puritan Migration as a film now run backwards.

Sir Stephen (Dedalus?--i.e., Joyce? cf., also, their "Noras") Dodson-Truck sees in circuit-symbols evidence of organic linguistic evolution--seeing in one symbol the "sun" (as in "Oxen of the . . .

Bloat now gone, Slothrop studies rocket manuals, which induce erections; Sir Stephen takes notes. Wanting more information, Slothrop sets up the drunken Prince of Wales game, after which, suitably drunk, Sir Stephen confesses what he knows. Shift (217) to Carroll Eventyr, to Leni Pökler and Peter Sachsa. Peter\'s death (220). Sir Stephen leaves.

Pointsman, who has been meeting with Clive Mossmoon (Scorpia\'s husband--remember?--he\'s in plastics), assures them that Brigadier Pudding will continue to support the project (i.e., to expose Slothrop to the Rocket and observe his responses). All leave, save Webley Silvernail, in whose fantasy (apparently) the lab animals sing and dance to "Pavlovia (Beguine)." Afterwards Silvernail, departing, tells them of the false "freedom" of the elite--"using every other form of life without mercy to keep what haunts men down to a tolerable level." Pudding sneaks through the terrors (arranged by Pointsman) of D wing to his assignation with Katje (as "Domina Nocturna"--this, too, arranged by Pointsman, who has plumbed the Brigadier\'s fantasies for something that will keep him in line). Katje indulges Pudding\'s "need for pain"; her shit, which he carefully swallows, recalls to him "the smell of Passchendaele, of the Salient"--his horrified memories of mass death and putrefaction in World War I.'),o.default.createElement("p",{id:"2-5"},'[5] 236-244.

Slothrop, bothered by evidence of links between Allied and German corporations, debates conspiracy as vs. "coincidence" with Hilary Bounce (of Shell Oil, although he wears a medal from I.G. Farben). Second Proverb (241). In a German parts list (one of the many he is studying, as part of Pointsman\'s experiment) Slothrop finds references to an insulation device, to a "Document SG-1," to "Imipolex G." Then, after getting Bounce out of the way, he uses Bounce\'s hotel-room teletype to get information about these things from Shell\'s London office. He then heads for a nonstop party, to which he\'s already sent Bounce, chez Raoul de la Perlimpinpin: "He\'ll read the information through later."'),o.default.createElement("p",{id:"2-6"},"[6] 244-249.

Waxwing gives Slothrop an envelope to hold for safe keeping. A "plot" is revealed (247: ',o.default.createElement("i",null,"you "),'figure it out). Tamara (part of the "plot") arrives in a tank, fires into party. Waxwing gives Slothrop a zoot suit, keychain, and his business card, "embossed with a chess knight and an address on Rue Rossini."  (The chess knight might also recall Nabokov--or, perhaps, the card of the hired gun, Palladin, played by Richard Boone in the 1950s TV Western series,',o.default.createElement("i",null,"Have Gun, Will Travel"),".)"),o.default.createElement("p",{id:"2-7"},'[7] 249-269.

Walter Rathenau, 166; also Slothrop\'s Plasticman comic, 206-7?) A brief history of the development of plastics, into increasingly complex molecular chains, is paralleled by a brief history of the development of interlocking "arrangements" among the corporations that manufacture them. (250-51) Slothrop fantasizes a commando raid on Duncan Sandys\' office at Shell Mex House, London; at the heart of it all he finds only machines, talking to one another.

Unfortunately there is no evidence that any of his "scores"-- not even Darlene (though there ',o.default.createElement("i",null,"is "),'a "Mrs. Quoad")--actually existed.

Moving deeper into the tunnel Slothrop hears our first rocket limericks (305-7), sung at a drunken Russian-American party, which he soon joins.

Enzian and Joseph Ombindi--the leader of the Empty One faction, and Enzian\'s main rival for power among the Zone Hereros--discuss suicide. "Sold on Suicide," song (320). Then we learn about various portions of Enzian\'s personal history: about his Russian sailor father, about the death of his mother (fleeing the Herero massacre), about his becoming the protoge and lover of Weissmann/Blicero.

Since Marvy is still after him, Slothrop heads for Berlin (by Geli's arrangement), in a balloon, with one Schnorp--who's flying in custard pies to sell on the black market.

"The Zone is in full summer." Cut to Tchitcherine, who "is more metal than anything else." He has two missions in the Zone. Official: to recover rockets and hardware for the Soviets. Private: to annihilate Enzian (his half brother) and the Schwarzkommando. We then cut to his past in Kirghiz ("the town looked like a Wild West movie"), where his assignment was to enforce the NTA (New Turkic Alphabet) on the unlettered natives (cf. this linguistic imperialism to the organic theories of language propounded by Sir Stephen Dodson-Truck [inverted "Turk"?] ',o.default.createElement("a",{onClick:e,href:"#2-3"},"2: [3]"),' above?). We learn about Galina, "the schoolmarm," and about Dzaqyp Qulan, the "native" schoolteacher, whose father was killed in the Kirghiz massacre of 1916 (cf. Fran van der Groov and the Dodoes, ',o.default.createElement("a",{onClick:e,href:"#1-14"},"1: [14]")," above? the Herero massacre, ",o.default.createElement("a",{href:"#1-14"},"1: [14]"),'above? the attitude toward Indians implied by all the Western lingo here?

There are various rumors (this flashback, like many in the book, is shifting into the present tense) about the reasons for Tchitcherine\'s banishment to Central Asia: an alliance with a "Soviet Courtesan"; an acquaintance with Wimpe, a German salesman for IG, with a special interest in "opium alkaloids and their many variations." Cut from this to the Chinese swamper, Chu Piang, with whom Tchitcherine smokes opium. Then we hear Wimpe discourse on Morphine research, on Laszlo Jamf (348). Or has Tchitcherine (as ',o.default.createElement("i",null,"he "),'thinks) been banished to Kirghiz (and Chekovian longing for return to the city) because of Enzian? We learn how Tchitcherine\'s sailor-father fled the horror of loading coal in a Southwest African port ("a conspiracy of carbon . . . he could smell Death in it") to the "honest blackness" of Enzian\'s mother (351). We then learn, in chaotic detail, about factional infighting at the NTA plenary session, and about the similarity of its committees to Soviet "Committees on molecular structure." (355) Tchitcherine and Dzaqyp Qulan ride into a village in time to hear a singing duel (cf. 387?)--and to hear an old aqyn (wandering singer) sing (we\'re into the Oral Tradition here, no writing) about seeing the "Kirghiz Light/In a place where words are unknown."

He recalls his second encounter with Enzian; the Schwarzkommando were dredging for pieces of rocket. He sees their symbol. Their disappointment at the serial number on what they dredge up reveals that they, too, are looking for the 00000 rocket. Enzian tells him the Herero mantra (since the massacre): "\'Mba-kayere . . . \'I am passed over.\'" Back in the basement, Slothrop considers his own quest: "The Schwarzgerät is no Grail, Ace." (364) He "will meet," we\'re told, Greta Erdmann, a former movie actress. "This is how they meet," we\'re told. Then we\'re told of Slothrop\'s meeting with Emil ("Säure" ["acid"]) Bummer, notorious cat burglar and doper, whose girls give Slothrop a Wagnerian opera costume (cape, helmet), transforming him into "Raketemensch" (Rocketman). They all proceed to the Chicago Bar, a dopers\' hangout, decorated with photos of John Dillinger. A song, "The Doper\'s Dream" (369), is sung by Seaman Bodine (known as "Pig" Bodine in V). Slothrop, now as Rocketman, is asked to go to Potsdam (where the Allied conference to work out the division of Germany is now taking place) to retrieve six kilos of hashish Bodine has buried there. For one of the kilos, and a million counterfeit marks printed by Bummer, he agrees. (NB.

Next morning, Bummer explains that the hash is buried across from Potsdam, "in Neubabelsberg, the old movie capital of Germany." Slothrop learns of the death of "his president," Roosevelt. (373) At mention of Schwarzgerät, Bummer suggests that Slothrop talk to "Der Springer." Now alone, with papers identifying him as "Max Schlepzig," Slothrop heads for Potsdam. His boots (Tchitcherine\'s, given to him by Geli) lead to interrogation by Russians, but they finally let him pass (it turns out, though, that they\'ve been in touch with Tchitcherine). He arrives at his destination, only to discover that during the Conference it\'s serving as Truman\'s residence. Digging up the hash beneath a balcony, he is suddenly staring face-to-face at Mickey Rooney (who, we\'re assured, will repress all memory of the encounter). Then, leaving, he is captured: "You were followed all the way."'),o.default.createElement("p",{id:"3-8"},"[8] 383-390. Cut to the hijacked U-boat of the Argentine anarchists (see ",o.default.createElement("a",{onClick:e,href:"#2-7"},"2: [7]")," above, Squalidozzi--remember?). We learn the story behind Squalidozzi's disappearance from Zürich. He was pursued by British Military Intelligence (Slothrop's Rolls Royce). He came upon a group of zoot-suited gangsters, Blodgett Waxwing's people, watching a Bob Steele Western in an abandoned harmonica factory, and meets Gerhardt von Göll (\"Der Springer\"), a German filmmaker (who made the Schwarzkommando film for Operation Blackwing--see",o.default.createElement("a",{onClick:e,href:"#1-14"},"1: [14]"),"above). He now offers to make a film of ",o.default.createElement("i",null,"Martin Fierro"),', an epic whose gaucho hero is regarded by the anarchists as a saint. This has now become the major project of the U-boat anarchists, but there is a problem: will they shoot only part one, or will they also do part two, in which the hero sells out? There is a fantasy of a scene from the (as yet unmade) film: Fierro\'s withdrawal from General Roca\'s attempt to exterminate the pampa Indians (cf. all the other genocidal massacres thus far: Dodoes, Hereros, Central Asian "natives"?). We learn about von Göll\'s connections with IG Farben, with Laszlo Jamf, about his best known film, the "immortal Alpdrücken." His interest in ',o.default.createElement("i",null,"Martin Fierro "),"stems mainly from the chance it offers to shoot a scene of a singing duel (387--cf. 3: [5] above?).

Slothrop\'s reassurance of Ludwig, worried about his lost lemming Ursula, 553-4, below? cf. the quite different attitude of Pointsman toward his "foxes," or of the Germans toward their horses and cows--337, above?). Slothrop leaves the white room in which he has been interrogated (after noting that some of the hash has been taken) to find himself in an abandoned movie set, where he meets (at last--see ',o.default.createElement("a",{onClick:e,href:"#3-6"},"3: [6] above"),") Margherita (Greta) Erdmann, the movie actress, who is looking for her lost daughter, Bianca.

Anyway, Slothrop and Greta act out the scene from ',o.default.createElement("i",null,"Alpdrücken")," (on the set of ",o.default.createElement("i",null,"Alpdrücken"),'), Slothrop as "Schlepzig," Greta as "Greta": bondage, whipping, sex.

(398) Franz is now (in "present") at the ruin of an amusement park-city, Zwölfkinder (cf. Disneyland?), waiting for Ilse\'s annual summertime return. He recalls his fear of the political demonstrations (the street) to which he lost Leni; he recalls an argument they had over the meaning of the Rocket, which he has come in his way (and out of his fear) to worship (400). He turned to the Rocket, in earnest, to pull himself together after Leni left him. He recalls the "electro-mysticism" of Kurt Mondaugen (see ',o.default.createElement("a",{onClick:e,href:"#1-19"},"1: [19]"),' above). His memories of early rocket days also include Weissmann (Blicero) and Enzian. He moved to Peenemünde (where rockets were tested) in 1937, but he couldn\'t quite forget his old Berlin self; he was torn between "personal identity and impersonal salvation." (406) We learn of the connection linking the Rocket, film, and calculus (407). Then, one summer, "Ilse" appeared at his cubicle, for a visit, reporting that she and Leni were living at an SS "reeducation" camp. Pökler dreamed about the history of Friedrich August Kekulé, father of organic chemistry (410-13), and about Kekulé\'s dream: a serpent with its tail in its mouth. We learn how this dream was misused by the System, as the foundation for understanding the benzine ring. All this is lectured on by "Pökler\'s old prof," Laszlo Jamf. Ilse\'s fantasy was to live on the moon. Then one evening, returning from work, Pökler found her gone. He was crushed: "Victim in a Vacuum," song (414-15). Mondaugen advised that he wait, rather than rebel; and Pökler agreed.',o.default.createElement("br",null),o.default.createElement("br",null),'As war approached Pökler became more enmeshed in the life of the Rocket (his life is often recalled, indeed, in terms appropriate to the rocket\'s flight).

(415) The next summer, again apparently arranged by Weissmann, there was another visit from "Ilse" (as before, he could not be certain it was she).

Pökler fantasized incest and escape (420-21), but instead accepted "Ilse" as his daughter: "It was the real moment of conception, in which, years too late, he became her father."

Pointsman/Pudding/Katje,',o.default.createElement("a",{onClick:e,href:"#2-4"},"2: [4]"),' above?) to keep Pökler in line.

Which, he learned, was where "Ilse" was imprisoned. Then Weissmann, whom Pökler had not seen since leaving Peenemünde (though he had heard rumors of a break with Enzian), appeared to get Pökler to work on modifications for a special rocket, the 00000. His job was to produce an insulated plastic fairing, to contain something called a "Schwarzgerät." He never saw Weissmann again; but his reward for this special work (apparently) was a letter from Weissmann, promising that "Ilse" would be freed, that she would meet him at Zwölfkinder (which is why he is there "now," waiting for her). With defeat approaching, and the Mittelwerke being evacuated, he finally got into Dora, next door.

Slothrop, as Military Police break down the door, escapes; he returns to Margherita, who, frightened and angered by his absence, proceeds to cry all day. As time passes, she is consoled, really, only by whippings, self-abasements, in which Slothrop, despite misgivings, participates: "Whatever it is with her, he\'s catching it."

Then (as it will be put later) he is "dispersed"; he "sees a very thick rainbow here, a stout rainbow cock driven down out of pubic clouds into Earth [cf. 693, below?] green wet valleyed Earth, and his chest fills and he stands crying, not a thing in his head, just feeling natural."

He recalls Jessica\'s last visit to "The White Visitation," his own need (which, however, wanes at times) to do "what\'s right" about Slothrop--whom Jessica regards mainly as a monster. The war over, Jessica was leaving--and left, to go to Cuxhaven, with Beaver (see ',o.default.createElement("a",{onClick:e,href:"#1-16"},"1: [16]"),"above). Milton Gloaming (see ",o.default.createElement("a",{onClick:e,href:"#1-5"},"1: [5]"),' above), back from the Zone, filled Roger in on "the great struggle for the IG\'s intelligence machinery" (630), to which Slothrop seemed quite important. Mexico arrives (still a flashback here, but now in the present tense) at Twelfth House, to confront Pointsman. Geza Rózsavögli (a "White Visitation" veteran) is there, in the reception room; backed into Pointsman\'s "shadow-corner," he enters a bizarre Hawaii fantasy (634-5; a Slothropian "appearance"?--note the language, and cf. Slothrop\'s shirt, ',o.default.createElement("a",{onClick:e,href:"#2-1"},"2: [1]")," above?). Mexico finds Pointsman in the office of Clive Mossmoon (see ",o.default.createElement("a",{onClick:e,href:"#1-4"},"1: [5]")," and",o.default.createElement("a",{onClick:e,href:"#2-4"},"2: [4]"),' above), where a meeting is in progress. He leaps on the conference table, and pisses all over the assembled elite--except Pointsman, whom he curses, elaborately. Then, after escaping, he goes to Pirate\'s, to be told about "Creative Paranoia," the need to combat the "They-system" with a "We-system." "Well," replies Roger, "you\'re playing Their game, then." (638) Sir Stephen Dodson-Truck is there (see',o.default.createElement("a",{onClick:e,href:"#2-3"},"2: [3]")," and ",o.default.createElement("a",{onClick:e,href:"#3-24"},"3: [24]")," above); we learn about the fate of his wife, Nora (see ",o.default.createElement("a",{onClick:e,href:"#1-18"},"1: [18]")," above): she has identified with Gravity, and become victim to practical jokes from her friends.

Eddie Pensiero, "amphetimine enthusiast" and expert reader of shivers, is giving a haircut to his colonel. An overhead bulb is kept lighted by a hand generator, cranked by Paddy ("Electro") McGonigle, an expert reader of strobing frequencies. They hear somebody "playing blues on a mouth harp" in the dark (624; another Slothropian "appearance"?). The colonel is from Kenosha, Wisconsin (cf. ',o.default.createElement("a",{onClick:e,href:"#1-10"},"1: [10]"),' above?). We shift (in the colonel\'s fantasy) to a dialogue between "Skippy" and "Mister Information"--about "Happyville," the "pointsman," the persistence of the War in which, still, "the right people are dying." (644-46) Then "Skippy" (turning back, more or less, into the colonel) meets Dr. Jamf. Then we learn that the bulb run by Paddy\'s generator is the ',o.default.createElement("i",null,"same "),'bulb that Franz Pökler slept under at Nordhausen (see 426-7, above): "This bulb is ',o.default.createElement("i",null,"immortal"),'"! Which brings us to "The Story of Byron the Bulb" (647-55), told to "Skippy" by "Mister Information." Byron\'s early dreams of power set him against "Phoebus"--the agency of the international light-bulb cartel which "fixes the prices and determines the operational lives of all the bulbs in the world." After 1000 hours, with a Phoebus hit-woman on her way to get him, Byron is bulb-snatched, and dispatched on a series of travels too bizarre to detail here. We learn, meanwhile, about the working arrangements between Phoebus and "The Grid." (654) Byron survives, but his early ambition has been thwarted; he "is condemned to go on forever, knowing the truth and powerless to change anything." (655; cf. Pirate\'s hopes for "Creative Paranoia," ',o.default.createElement("a",{onClick:e,href:"#4-2"},"4: [2]"),' above?) The story over, Lazslo Jamf ("Mr. Information"?) walks away; "the colonel is left alone in Happyville."

Katje, in a white tennis dress, on a stolen bicycle, meets the Hereros, in white sailor suits, singing "Pa-ra-noooiia" (657; "ooooi"?). She was not ready for the "blackness." She meets, for the first time, Enzian, who talks to her about the "Raketen-Stadt" (660; cf. ',o.default.createElement("a",{onClick:e,href:"#4-6"},"4: [6]"),'below?), and about Weissmann: "Whatever happened at the end, he has transcended." (660-61) He recalls what Weissmann, in a letter, said about Katje (662). He tells her the Hereros have someone "who was with Blicero in May" (this being, we learn in the next chapter, Thanatz--see',o.default.createElement("a",{onClick:e,href:"#3-14"},"3: [14]")," above).

He was rescued by a Polish undertaker, trying (in order to make him better in his particular line of work) to get struck by lightning--seeking to "experience a singular point." After setting Thanatz ashore, he gets his wish (664-65). Thanatz then encounters a village of male homosexuals, liberated (or, as they see it, "banished") from Dora (see ',o.default.createElement("a",{onClick:e,href:"#3-11"},"3: [11]"),' above). They have reproduced, in their "freedom," a "phantom SS command," modelled on their fantasy of the Rocket-structure at the Mittelwerke. They are waiting for Blicero, of whom they\'ve only heard, to be their leader. Thanatz has come to be haunted by his memories of Blicero (see ',o.default.createElement("a",{onClick:e,href:"#3-14"},"3: [14]")," above). He seeks him out, however, at a nearby gasworks--recalling, meanwhile, Peter Sachsa's prewar séances (668; see ",o.default.createElement("a",{onClick:e,href:"#1-5"},"1: [5]")," ",o.default.createElement("a",{onClick:e,href:"#1-18"},"[18]")," and",o.default.createElement("a",{onClick:e,href:"#1-19"},"[19]"),' above). Thanatz is nabbed by the Russians, then freed (by mistake) by Polish guerillas. So begin his "lessons in being preterite" (668). He travels the Zone as a DP. His memory of the last rocket-firing grows clearer--which he is now (i.e., in the "present" of the close of the previous chapter) relating to the Schwarzkommando. He\'s coming to see that "the two children, Gottfried and Bianca, ',o.default.createElement("i",null,"are the same"),'." (672) Telling all he remembers to the assembled Erdschweinhöhlers, "he is the angel they\'ve hoped for." They have already assembled their own rocket from scavenged fragments (cf. Mexico to Pointsman, 88, above?). And by the time he\'s done "they will all know what the Schwarzgerät was, how it was used, where the 00000 was fired from, and which way it was pointed." (673) All this brings the various Herero factions together, reconciles them.

(This long, bizarre chapter may give us [see, for instance, 682, below] what\'s left of Slothrop\'s "point of view," since his "dispersal.") We are in the Raketen-Stadt, "where the',o.default.createElement("i",null,"Father "),'["Broderick"--see ',o.default.createElement("a",{onClick:e,href:"#3-1"},"3: [1]"),' above] plots constantly to kill his son." Tyrone sets out to rescue the "Radiant Hour," stolen from the day\'s 24 by "colleagues of the Father, for sinister reasons of their own." (674) The "Floundering Four"--Tyrone, Myrtle Miraculous (she can perform miracles), Maximillian ("a Negro in a pearl-gray zoot suit and Inverness cape"), and Marcel ("a mechanical chess-player") set out to combat the "Paternal Peril." Each has a flaw (cf. Dorothy\'s three companions in ',o.default.createElement("i",null,"The Wizard of Oz"),'?). Song, "How-dy neighbor, how-dy pard!" (677; cf. various details to 760, below?) They gradually infiltrate their own audience (or someone else\'s). Maximillian is reading "the Closet Intellectual Book, ',o.default.createElement("i",null,"The Wisdom of the Great Kamikaze Pilots"),', with illustrations by Walt Disney." Then, as parts of the "nonstop revue," watched by the now-infiltrated-audience, various sketches. "The Low Frequency Listener" (681-2): Slothrop, for reasons he can\'t remember, is trying to get through to the Argentine anarchists. He\'s at Magdeburg, site of a low-frequency antenna. He\'s having trouble remembering his parents, "as Broderick progresses into Perilous Pop and Nalline into ssshhhghh . . ." (682) Next (in the "revue"), "Mom Slothrop\'s Letter to Ambassador Kennedy" (682): she asks, familiarly and drunkenly, for news of Tyrone. Then, "On the Phrase \'Ass Backwards\'" (683-87): Säure Bummer, talking to Slothrop, attacks the illogic of this phrase. We learn about the umlaut-deficient robbery victim (female) who, meaning to shout "Hübsch Räuber ("cute-looking robber"), instead came out with "Hubschrauber" ("helicopter," which had not yet been invented) (683-4). Seaman Bodine, after defending "Ass Backwards," sings "My Doper\'s Cadenza" (685-6). Then (still the "revue"), "Shit \'n\' Shinola" (687-8): their color is contrasted with the white of toilets--"Odorless and Official Death." Next, "An Incident in the Transvestites\' Toilet" (688-90): Slothrop\'s dressed in drag, as Fay Wray. An ape hands him a sodium bomb, which explodes when flushed down the toilet by an Asian--also in drag, as Margaret O\'Brien. Next, "A Moment of Fun with Takeshi and Ichizo, the Komical Kamikazes" (690-92): they keep learning from "old Kenosha (cf.

Then, "Streets" (692-94): Slothrop finds (he doesn\'t know where) a newspaper fragment--"a wirephoto of a giant white cock, dangling in the sky downward out of a white pubic bush" (cf. 626, above?) under a partial headline: "MB DRO / ROSHI (cf. 480, above? But NB., also, "Roshi" is the title of the highest Zen master.)

(696)--where the Kenosha Kid is caught in a "sound-shadow" (cf. ',o.default.createElement("a",{onClick:e,href:"#4-2"},"4: [2]"),'above?). Then, "Witty Repartee" (697-98): more of Ichizo and Takeshi, then some information on the Hotchkiss machine gun. Then, "Heart-to-Heart, Man-to-Man" (698-99): "Pop" and "Tyrone" discuss the latter\'s growing "electrofreak" addiction to "screwing in," "waves."

Roger recalls (another flashback shifting into present tense) Jessica telling him, in Cuxhaven, of her decision to marry Jeremy.

Blicero tells Gottfried about his search for "the edge of the World," and about earlier "edges," such as America, Africa--gifts, ways of "returning," which Europe refused, establishing instead "its order of Analysis and Death." "In time," he explains, "the death-colonies grew strong enough to break away [cf. Brenschluss?]. But the impulse to empire, the mission to propagate death, the structure of it, kept on."

They have reached the Lüneberg Heath, where the Hereros are assembling the 00001 rocket. We learn the story of "the kid who hates kreplach" (737). Slothrop was to be "present at . . .

We\'re told about "the movie under the rug," in which various irreversible processes are reversed. "Weissmann\'s Tarot" (746-49): "He is the father you will never quite manage to kill. The Oedipal situation in the Zone these days is terrible" (747). Weissmann\'s present condition is set forth by the Tower, over whose significance there is considerable debate. Others of his cards are analyzed. "The Last Green and Magenta" (749): on the Heath. "The Horse" (749): the last horse in waiting to be sacrificed (cf. 337, above?).

And Gottfried himself is the "Schwarzgerät." "Hardware" (751): Gottfried is encased in Imipolex. There is an earphone for communications from Weissmann, but there is no return channel. "Chase Music" (751-53): various aging super-heroes (e.g., Superman, The Lone Ranger, Philip Marlowe) begin arriving "too late." "He [i.e., Pointsman] actually misses the dogs."

Steve Edelman is one of the principal trouble-makers. Zhlubb takes our reporter for a drive in his black Volkswagen, with its special laugh-track cassette system. They pass a funeral (JFK? RFK?).
