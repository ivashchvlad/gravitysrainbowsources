                <h3>PROLOGUE</h3>
                <p>
                    The book's "present" (narrated, throughout, in the present tense) begins late in 1944. The
                    Allies are winning World War II on the ground, but the Germans are still
                    firing V-2 rockets at
                    London. Flashbacks (or events remembered by various characters) usually
                    begin in the past
                    tense, but they tend to shift rapidly into the present tense (for a significant
                    exception--a flashback
                    narrated entirely in the past tense--see the story of Franz P&ouml;kler, <a href="#3-11">3: [11]</a>).
                    The narrator is also
                    capable, upon occasion, of flashes <i>forward</i>. Point of view shifts
                    frequently (see, for instance, <a href="#1-14">1: [14]</a>) and is sometimes indeterminate ("omniscient"?).
                    And much of what "happens" (it's hard to
                    say how much) is fantasy (it's often hard to say whose). The sections
                    (chapters?) of each of the
                    four numbered parts of the book, divided by rows of small squares (film
                    sprockets?), are here for
                    convenience numbered (in [brackets]). Page numbers for each "chapter" (or
                    for quotations) refer
                    to the 1973 Viking Compass edition of <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i>.
                    What follows is, in a sense, designed
                    as a "plot summary." But it is designed as an accompaniment to a reading
                    of <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i>--and to be useless as a substitute for
                    a reading of the book.

                        marked for number of
                        rocket impacts. The frequency of such impacts obeys (as Roger has predicted)
                        the Poisson
                        distribution. Some oppositions emerge: science vs. love, war vs. love.

                        sentence, "You never did the Kenosha Kid." Stimulated by an injection of

                        into the toilet; he
                        follows it--"getting into some, oh really weird shit." Segue to the adventures

                206-7?) A brief
                history of the development of plastics, into increasingly complex molecular
                chains, is paralleled
                by a brief history of the development of interlocking "arrangements" among
                the corporations that
                manufacture them. (250-51) Slothrop fantasizes a commando raid on Duncan
                Sandys' office at
                Shell Mex House, London; at the heart of it all he finds only machines, talking
                to one another.
                Returned from fantasy (?), he finds a new clue on the parts list:
                "S-Ger&auml;t, 11/00000"--apparently
                the serial number of a special model rocket, using Imipolex G, somehow, for
                insulation.

                    <p>
                        Slothrop comes upon (by chance?) a copy (forged?) of the London
                <i>Times</i>, containing an obituary,
                by Bloat, for Tantivy, supposedly killed in heroic action. He flees to Nice
                (as, we learn later, he
                was supposed to), going to the address on Waxwing's card. During the night
                he is visited by
                various dead and/or departed. Next day, Waxwing's agents give him new papers,
                a new name
                (Ian Scuffling), and an address in Z&uuml;rich. He arrives a week later,
                and contacts Waxwing's
                representative, Semyavin. He meets (in a musical "number") various "Loonies
                on Leave!" (259-60) Looking for sources of information in information-specific
                caf&eacute;s, he meets Mario Schweitar,
                who tells him of Jamf's death.
            </p>
                    <p>
                        Schweitar offers more information for a price, but Slothrop is broke.
                        And seeing a strange Rolls
                        Royce in front of his hotel, Slothrop recognizes that he cannot return, that
                        he is also homeless.
                        Proverb #4 (262). He pawns his zoot suit and wanders. At the Odeon Cafe
                        (which is not
                        information-specific) he meets an Argentine anarchist, Francesco Squalidozzi,
                        who tells of
                        hijacking a German U-boat (with Graciela Imago Portales) to seek asylum from
                        Peron in, yes,
                Germany. Why <i>Germany</i>? Squalidozzi on Argentine history: "We are
                obsessed with building
                labyrinths, where before there was open plain and sky. . . . We cannot abide
                that <i>openness</i>; it is
                terror to us." Slothrop counters: "But-but . . . that's <i>progress</i>."
                Squalidozzi: "In the openness of
                the German zone, our hope is limitless." The Argentines need a courier,
                unknown to their
                enemies. Slothrop offers to help, for enough money to pay Schweitar for
                his information.
            </p>
                    <p>
                        Slothrop takes a plane to Geneva (in plane encountering Richard Halliburton
                        [266]). He
                        exchanges messages with Squalidozzi's contact, then returns to Z&uuml;rich.
                        Squalidozzi is nowhere
                        to be found. We learn of the Slothrop family's role in Shay's Rebellion.
                        (268) Slothrop goes out
                        to stay at Jamf's tomb, where he take delivery of Schweitar's information:
                        "In the weeks ahead . .
                        . he may even have time to wish he hadn't read any of it."

                        [8] 269-278. May: A "White Visitation" picnic by the sea (cf. opening
                        of part 2?). Pointsman
                        thinks about the disappearance of Slothrop, lost by British Intelligence
                        a month ago, in Z&uuml;rich.
                        He thinks, as well, about his major blunder: authorizing Harvey Speed and
                        Floyd Perdoo to
                        investigate Slothrop's sexual adventures in London, the ones recorded on
                        the map (this operation
                        being known, acronimically, as SEZ WHO). Unfortunately there is no evidence
                        that any of his
                "scores"-- not even Darlene (though there <i>is </i>a "Mrs. Quoad")--actually
                existed. The War over,
                Pointsman must confront efforts to dissolve PISCES (as well as more general
                tendencies to
                dissolve the stark polarities sustained by the War). He has begun to feel
                "the solitude of a
                F&uuml;hrer." Back to the sea-side, we get our first allusion to the Rossini
                vs. Beethoven controversy--which, we're told (presumably, here, by the narrator),
                will later erupt in Berlin. Pointsman,
                facing his various dissolutions, begins to act "a bit mental"--he's hearing
                a Voice. We learn, as
                those at "The White Visitation" have recently learned, that there really
                <i>is</i> a "Schwarzkommando"
                operating in Germany, just as in the "fiction" created by Operation Blackwing.
                All this following
                a digression on <i>King Kong</i>. (Here, as with the Rocket [and Slothrop]
                the order of cause and
                effect seems to be getting reversed or confused: can fantasy
                <i>produce </i>reality?) Edwin Treacle has
                contended, to his consternated colleagues, "that their feelings about blackness
                were tied to
                feelings about shit, and feelings about shit to feelings about putrefaction
                and death." (276)
                Pointsman, hallucinating, sees need to get Jessica out of the way, in order
                to secure control of
                Roger for his continuation of the War into the Post-War. "'Yang and Yin,'
                whispers the Voice,
                'Yang and Yin. . . . '" (a Pavlovian breakdown?--a dissolution of "ideas
                of the opposite"?).

                        [1] 281-295. Early morning (cf. dawn openings of parts 1 and 2?): Slothrop
                        arrives at
                        Nordhausen. He recalls meeting his first African (Enzian), and Major Duane
                        Marvy. The "plot"
                        [which will thicken, then, strangely, thin]: Schweitar's information on
                Imipolex G (see <a href="#2-7">2: [7]</a>
                above) points to Franz P&ouml;kler (see
                <a href="#1-18">1: [18]</a> and <a href="#1-19">[19]</a> above), who came
                to the Mittelwerke, an
                underground rocket factory at Nordhausen, in 1944. The Shell file on Jamf
                points to Lyle Bland
                of Boston, to Hugo Stinnes (a German financier), and to a banknote contract
                with the Slothrop
                Paper Company. All this recalls to Slothrop a smell ("<i>the breath of the
                    Forbidden Wing</i>"
                [presumably Imipolex G, involved in Jamf's experiments on "Infant Tyrone"]);
                it also produces
                an erection. Bland ("Uncle Lyle") apparently sold his interest in the
                "Schwarzknabe enterprise"
                (next to this entry are the initials, "T.S.") to Gr&ouml;ssli Chemical (later
                Psychochemie AG). From
                all this Slothrop concludes that his father Broderick ("B.S.") "sold" him
                to Bland, for Jamf's
                experiments, in return for money for Slothrop's education; and Slothrop's
                apparently been under
                surveillance ever since.

                        Slothrop--travelling in the Zone as a British journalist, Ian Scuffling--also
                        recalls Marvy, on top
                        of a moving railroad car, warning him about "niggers" in the next car, Southwest
                        African rocket
                        troops (the Scwarzkommando), who have now joined together, heading for
                        Nordhausen. He then
                        recalls Oberst Enzian appearing, and throwing Marvy off the train.

                        Cut back to "present," Nordhausen, morning. Slothrop meets Geli Tripping
                        (say it out loud), an
                        apprentice witch, part of the "harem" ("a girl in every rocket-town in the
                        Zone") of Soviet officer,
                        Vaslav Tchitcherine. After sex he begins worrying the Russian is about to
                        appear, but the noise
                        he hears is only Geli's owl, Wernher. It turns out she knows about the 00000
                        rocket, and the
                        "Schwarzger&auml;t." Proverb #5 (292). She claims the Schwarzger&auml;t
                        is for sale, in Swinem&uuml;nde.
                        Despite misgivings, Slothrop stays the night.

                        [2] 295-314. Next morning, Slothrop, in a pair of Tchitcherine's
                        boots
                        (a gift from Geli), heads
                        for the Mittelwerke. The entrance-arch is a parabola, designed by Etzel
                        (cf. the unsuccessful
                        American automobile?) &Ouml;lsh, a disciple of Albert Speer. Inside, joined
                        by forty-four Stollen, are
                        two parallel, S-shaped tunnels (a tribute both to the SS and to the double
                        integral sign--but cf.
                        198). We are treated to a meditation on the importance of the double integral
                        and Brenschluss
                (301). We learn Slothrop's reasons (cf. <a href="#2-8">2: [8]</a> above) for editing and
                falsifying information,
                changing names, on his London map (302). Moving deeper into the tunnel Slothrop
                hears our
                first rocket limericks (305-7), sung at a drunken Russian-American party,
                which he soon joins. It
                turns out to be a going away party for Major Marvy who, when he sees Slothrop,
                takes off after
                him, with his men: "Marvy's Mothers." Taking cover in one of the Stollen,
                Slothrop meets
                Professor (of mathematics) Glimpf, with whom he achieves a crazy silent-movie
                escape, via
                railroad. They proceed to the castle-laboratory of Glimpf's former colleague,
                the mad scientist,
                Zwitter.

                        [3] 314-329. We now meet the Schwarzkommando, and learn about the history
                        of the Zone
                        Hereros, the "Erdschweinh&ouml;hle." We learn about the Empty Ones,
                        "Revolutionaries of the Zero .
                        . . [whose] program is racial suicide," and about the true (Marx notwithstanding)
                        function of
                        colonies (317). Enzian and Joseph Ombindi--the leader of the Empty One faction,
                        and Enzian's
                        main rival for power among the Zone Hereros--discuss suicide. "Sold on Suicide,"
                        song (320).
                        Then we learn about various portions of Enzian's personal history: about
                        his Russian sailor
                        father, about the death of his mother (fleeing the Herero massacre), about
                        his becoming the
                        protoge and lover of Weissmann/Blicero. Responding to a radio call for help,
                        from another band
                        of Zone Hereros, he heads for Hamburg. We learn that Tchitcherine is his
                        half brother.

                        [4] 329-336. Slothrop and Geli are on the top of the Brocken, awaiting
                        sunrise. We learn about
                        Slothrop's Antinomian-witch ancestor, Amy Sprue, hanged at Salem (329).
                        Slothrop and Geli, as
                        the sun rises, watch their gigantic shadows in the clouds. Since Marvy is
                        still after him, Slothrop
                        heads for Berlin (by Geli's arrangement), in a balloon, with one Schnorp--who's
                        flying in custard
                        pies to sell on the black market. They are pursued by Marvy and his Mothers
                        in a plane. More
                        rocket limericks (334-5). The balloon, after a custard-pie battle, escapes.

                        [5] 336-359. "The Zone is in full summer." Cut to Tchitcherine, who
                        "is more metal than
                        anything else." He has two missions in the Zone. Official: to recover
                        rockets and hardware for
                        the Soviets. Private: to annihilate Enzian (his half brother) and the
                        Schwarzkommando. We
                        then cut to his past in Kirghiz ("the town looked like a Wild West movie"),
                        where his assignment
                        was to enforce the NTA (New Turkic Alphabet) on the unlettered natives (cf.
                        this linguistic

                and about Dzaqyp
                Qulan, the "native" schoolteacher, whose father was killed in the Kirghiz
                massacre of 1916 (cf.

                We learn, too, about
                Tchitcherine's horse, Snake, from the United States. There are various rumors
                (this flashback,
                like many in the book, is shifting into the present tense) about the reasons
                for Tchitcherine's
                banishment to Central Asia: an alliance with a "Soviet Courtesan"; an
                acquaintance with
                Wimpe, a German salesman for IG, with a special interest in "opium alkaloids
                and their many
                variations." Cut from this to the Chinese swamper, Chu Piang, with whom
                Tchitcherine smokes
                opium. Then we hear Wimpe discourse on Morphine research, on Laszlo Jamf
                (348). Or has
                Tchitcherine (as <i>he </i>thinks) been banished to Kirghiz (and Chekovian
                longing for return to the
                city) because of Enzian? We learn how Tchitcherine's sailor-father fled
                the horror of loading
                coal in a Southwest African port ("a conspiracy of carbon . . . he could
                smell Death in it") to the
                "honest blackness" of Enzian's mother (351). We then learn, in chaotic detail,
                about factional
                infighting at the NTA plenary session, and about the similarity of its committees
                to Soviet
                "Committees on molecular structure." (355) Tchitcherine and Dzaqyp Qulan
                ride into a village
                in time to hear a singing duel (cf. 387?)--and to hear an old aqyn (wandering
                singer) sing (we're
                into the Oral Tradition here, no writing) about seeing the "Kirghiz Light/In
                a place where words
                are unknown." Following his instructions the Russian and his sidekick travel
                to It, but Tchitcherine's "heart was never ready." "But in the Zone . .
                . the Rocket is waiting. He will be drawn the
                same way again."

                        [6] 359-371. Slothrop lies sick (he drank the water!) in a Berlin basement.
                        He recalls his
                        second encounter with Enzian; the Schwarzkommando were dredging for pieces
                        of rocket. He
                        sees their symbol. Their disappointment at the serial number on what they
                        dredge up reveals that
                        they, too, are looking for the 00000 rocket. Enzian tells him the Herero
                        mantra (since the
                        massacre): "'Mba-kayere . . . 'I am passed over.'" Back in the basement,
                        Slothrop considers his
                        own quest: "The Schwarzger&auml;t is no Grail, Ace." (364) He "will meet,"
                        we're told, Greta
                        Erdmann, a former movie actress. "This is how they meet," we're told. Then
                        we're told of
                        Slothrop's meeting with Emil ("S&auml;ure" ["acid"]) Bummer, notorious cat
                        burglar and doper, whose
                        girls give Slothrop a Wagnerian opera costume (cape, helmet), transforming
                        him into
                        "Raketemensch" (Rocketman). They all proceed to the Chicago Bar, a dopers'
                        hangout,
                        decorated with photos of John Dillinger. A song, "The Doper's Dream" (369),
                        is sung by Seaman
                        Bodine (known as "Pig" Bodine in V). Slothrop, now as Rocketman,
                        is asked to go to Potsdam
                        (where the Allied conference to work out the division of Germany is now taking
                        place) to
                        retrieve six kilos of hashish Bodine has buried there. For one of the kilos,
                        and a million
                        counterfeit marks printed by Bummer, he agrees. (NB. We're still waiting
                        to find out just how
                        Slothrop meets Greta Erdmann.)

                        [7] 371-383. Next morning, Bummer explains that the hash is buried across
                        from Potsdam, "in
                        Neubabelsberg, the old movie capital of Germany." Slothrop learns of the
                        death of "his
                        president," Roosevelt. (373) At mention of Schwarzger&auml;t, Bummer suggests
                        that Slothrop talk to
                        "Der Springer." Now alone, with papers identifying him as "Max Schlepzig,"
                        Slothrop heads for
                        Potsdam. His boots (Tchitcherine's, given to him by Geli) lead to interrogation
                        by Russians, but
                        they finally let him pass (it turns out, though, that they've been in touch
                        with Tchitcherine). He
                        arrives at his destination, only to discover that during the Conference it's
                        serving as Truman's
                        residence. Digging up the hash beneath a balcony, he is suddenly staring
                        face-to-face at Mickey
                        Rooney (who, we're assured, will repress all memory of the encounter). Then,
                        leaving, he is
                        captured: "You were followed all the way."

                (see <a href="#2-7">2: [7]</a> above,
                Squalidozzi--remember?). We learn the story behind Squalidozzi's disappearance
                from Z&uuml;rich.
                He was pursued by British Military Intelligence (Slothrop's Rolls Royce).
                He came upon a group
                of zoot-suited gangsters, Blodgett Waxwing's people, watching a Bob Steele
                Western in an
                abandoned harmonica factory, and meets Gerhardt von G&ouml;ll ("Der Springer"),
                a German
                filmmaker (who made the Schwarzkommando film for Operation Blackwing--see
                <a href="#1-14">1: [14]</a>
                above). He now offers to make a film of <i>Martin Fierro</i>, an epic
                whose gaucho hero is regarded
                by the anarchists as a saint. This has now become the major project of the
                U-boat anarchists, but
                there is a problem: will they shoot only part one, or will they also do
                part two, in which the hero
                sells out? There is a fantasy of a scene from the (as yet unmade) film:
                Fierro's withdrawal from
                General Roca's attempt to exterminate the pampa Indians (cf. all the other
                genocidal massacres
                thus far: Dodoes, Hereros, Central Asian "natives"?). We learn about von
                G&ouml;ll's connections
                with IG Farben, with Laszlo Jamf, about his best known film, the "immortal
                Alpdr&uuml;cken." His
                interest in <i>Martin Fierro </i>stems mainly from the chance it offers
                to shoot a scene of a singing duel
                (387--cf. 3: [5] above?). The plan, then: to get to the L&uuml;neberg
                Heath, meet von G&ouml;ll (who will
                arrive separately), and shoot the movie there. The U-boat fires a torpedo
                at the U.S.S. <i>John E. Badass </i>(Seaman Bodine's ship); but it misses,
                apparently because Bodine
                has added Oneirine
                ("Laszlo Jamf's celebrated intoxicant") to the coffee.

                        and worried about
                        little birds in a storm, being reassured by his father: "Don't worry, son"
                        (cf. Slothrop's

                        interrogated (after
                        noting that some of the hash has been taken) to find himself in an abandoned
                        movie set, where he
                meets (at last--see <a href="#3-6">3: [6] above</a>) Margherita (Greta) Erdmann, the movie
                actress, who is looking
                for her lost daughter, Bianca. They come to the set of von G&ouml;ll's
                <i>Alpdr&uuml;cken</i>, in which she (as
                victim) played opposite Max Schlepzig (as torturer), and during the filming
                of which, she
                believes, Bianca was conceived. Slothrop is bothered by the coincidence
                (?) of names--his
                papers identify <i>him</i>, after all, as "Max Schlepzig" (and the handwriting
                on the pass, Greta claims,
                is that of the "real" Max). Anyway, Slothrop and Greta act out the scene
                from <i>Alpdr&uuml;cken</i> (on
                the set of <i>Alpdr&uuml;cken</i>), Slothrop as "Schlepzig," Greta as "Greta":
                bondage, whipping, sex. The
                transition from Greta's stocking to her bare thigh leads the narrator
                (apparently) to a meditation

                from seeing
                <i>Alpdr&uuml;cken</i> that inspired the conception of Franz and Leni's
                daughter, Ilse (cf. Ilse, therefore, to
                Margherita's daughter, Bianca, conceived during the <i>shooting</i> of

                Franz is now (in "present") at the ruin of an amusement park-city,
                Zw&ouml;lfkinder (cf. Disneyland?),
                waiting for Ilse's annual summertime return. He recalls his fear of the
                political demonstrations
                (the street) to which he lost Leni; he recalls an argument they had over
                the meaning of the
                Rocket, which he has come in his way (and out of his fear) to worship (400).
                He turned to the
                Rocket, in earnest, to pull himself together after Leni left him. He recalls
                the "electro-mysticism"
                of Kurt Mondaugen (see <a href="#1-19">1: [19]</a> above). His memories of early rocket days
                also include
                Weissmann (Blicero) and Enzian. He moved to Peenem&uuml;nde (where rockets
                were tested) in
                1937, but he couldn't quite forget his old Berlin self; he was torn between
                "personal identity and
                impersonal salvation." (406) We learn of the connection linking the Rocket,
                film, and calculus
                (407). Then, one summer, "Ilse" appeared at his cubicle, for a visit, reporting
                that she and Leni
                were living at an SS "reeducation" camp. P&ouml;kler dreamed about the history
                of Friedrich August
                Kekul&eacute;, father of organic chemistry (410-13), and about Kekul&eacute;'s
                dream: a serpent with its tail in
                its mouth. We learn how this dream was misused by the System, as the foundation
                for
                understanding the benzine ring. All this is lectured on by "P&ouml;kler's
                old prof," Laszlo Jamf. Ilse's
                fantasy was to live on the moon. Then one evening, returning from work,
                P&ouml;kler found her gone.
                He was crushed: "Victim in a Vacuum," song (414-15). Mondaugen advised
                that he wait, rather
                than rebel; and P&ouml;kler agreed.<br /><br />As war approached P&ouml;kler
                became more enmeshed in the life of the
                Rocket (his life is often
                recalled, indeed, in terms appropriate to the rocket's flight). "It is the
                grim phoenix," we are told,
                "which creates its own holocaust . . . delibeate <i>resurrection</i>.
                . . the planet of National
                Socialism." (415) The next summer, again apparently arranged by Weissmann,
                there was another
                visit from "Ilse" (as before, he could not be certain it was she). This
                time he was granted a two-week furlough; they went to Zw&ouml;lfkinder, whose
                exhibits recapitulate many motifs from earlier
                portions of <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i>. P&ouml;kler fantasized incest and
                escape (420-21), but instead
                accepted "Ilse" as his daughter: "It was the real moment of conception,
                in which, years too late,
                he became her father." (421) Then, the two weeks over, she disappeared again.
                And "so it has
                gone for the six years since," his need of her used by Weissmann (cf.
                Pointsman/Pudding/Katje,
                <a href="#2-4">2: [4]</a> above?) to keep P&ouml;kler in line. He compares her regularly repeated
                appearances to the
                regular repetition of frames in film: she is "the moving image of a daughter."

                        He was transferred, in 1944, to Nordhausen, where he dreamed about a light
                        bulb (426-27: cf.
                "The Story of Byron the Bulb," <a href="#4-3">4: [3]</a> below?). He became increasingly aware
                of the
                concentration camp, Dora, next to Nordhausen. Which, he learned, was where
                "Ilse" was
                imprisoned. Then Weissmann, whom P&ouml;kler had not seen since leaving
                Peenem&uuml;nde (though he
                had heard rumors of a break with Enzian), appeared to get P&ouml;kler to
                work on modifications for a
                special rocket, the 00000. His job was to produce an insulated plastic fairing,
                to contain
                something called a "Schwarzger&auml;t." He never saw Weissmann again; but
                his reward for this
                special work (apparently) was a letter from Weissmann, promising that "Ilse"
                would be freed,
                that she would meet him at Zw&ouml;lfkinder (which is why he is there "now,"
                waiting for her). With
                defeat approaching, and the Mittelwerke being evacuated, he finally got into
                Dora, next door. He
                was appalled at what he saw: endless stacks of bodies, the others near death,
                emaciated, starving.
                Onto the finger of "a woman lying, a random woman," he slipped his gold wedding
                ring.

                        where nothing is connected
                to anything [cf. <i>The Waste Land</i>, lines 301-302?] a condition
                not many of us can bear for long. .
                . . Either They have put him here for a reason, or he's just here. He isn't
                sure that he wouldn't,
                actually, rather have that <i>reason </i>. . . ." (434) Leaving Margherita
                asleep, he takes five kilos of the
                hashish liberated from Potsdam (keeping the depleted sixth kilo for himself)
                to the Chicago Bar
                (see <a href="#3-6">3: [6]</a> above), then to S&auml;ure Bummer's cellar. It is abandoned,
                but he finds a white knight
                (symbol of Der Springer), made out of plastic (guess which kind?), with a
                message from S&auml;ure.
                He finally, at dawn, finds Bummer, and delivers the hash. His task accomplished,
                Slothrop retires
                to a mattress with Trudi, for an episode of polymorphous perversity--he "does
                not feel obliged to
                have a hardon"--and, finally, <i>nasal sex</i>! (439) We learn about the
                ongoing debate about the
                relative merits of Beethoven (supported by Gustav) and Rossini (supported
                by S&auml;ure (439ff.).
                They have just learned of the death of Anton Webern, shot (by "accident"?)
                by an American
                soldier, in Vienna. S&auml;ure and Gustav engage ("jointly"?) in a grass-tasting
                ritual (442). Slothrop,
                as Military Police break down the door, escapes; he returns to Margherita,
                who, frightened and
                angered by his absence, proceeds to cry all day. As time passes, she is
                consoled, really, only by
                whippings, self-abasements, in which Slothrop, despite misgivings, participates:
                "Whatever it is
                with her, he's catching it." He dreams of a woman fucked by a multitude
                of animals; in death
                (witnessed by "Old Squalidozzi, ploughman of the deep") she becomes a figure
                of abundant
                fertility. (446-7)

                        [14] 457-468. Slothrop, still as Rocketman, and Greta are heading for
                        Swinem&uuml;nde--he to find
                        the Schwarzger&auml;t, she to find her daughter, Bianca, who's supposed to
                        be with "a yachtful of
                        refugees." They come to Bad Karma (can you find it on a map?). Margherita
                        flees at the sight of
                        a woman in black, one whom Slothrop "could have ignored, passed over." (458)
                        Some time after
                        Greta's reappearance, her flight remaining unexplained, they watch the arrival
                        of the yacht,
                <i>Anubis</i> (cf. the jackal-headed Egyptian dead god, worshipped to placate
                tomb-ravaging jackals?).
                Greta goes on board but Slothrop, hesitating, falls in the water. To keep
                from sinking he slips
                out of his Rocketman outfit (cf. the ending of Melville's
                <i>White-Jacket</i>?). He finally gets aboard,
                though, helped through a porthole by Stefania Procalowska, the wife of the
                yacht's owner,
                Antonio. She tells Slothrop about the scene in <i>Alpdr&uuml;cken</i>,
                cut from the release print, during the
                filming of which Bianca was conceived: the gang-rape of Margherita by a
                horde of black-hooded
                "jackal men" (461). She also mentions "Karel," and Margherita's husband,
                Miklos Thanatz
                ("Thanatz" being the Egyptian god of intelligence or learning--but cf., also,
                "thanatos"?). During
                the war, Stefania continues, Margherita and Thanatz had a touring sado-masochist
                pornography
                show, which entertained SS troops at concentration camps and rocket sites.

                        Her story over, Stefania gives Slothrop some evening clothes, which "fit
                        perfectly." He proceeds
                        to the bar, where the assembled company sings "Welcome Aboard!" (462-3)
                        In the midst of what
                        seems to be an ongoing orgy, Slothrop catches sight of Bianca, who is eleven
                        or twelve, "a
                        knockout." A woman tells how Margherita, meeting Wimpe in Berlin
                (see <a href="#3-5">3: [5]</a> above),
                discovered her now favorite drug, Oneirine (developed--remember?--by Laszlo
                Jamf; see <a href="#3-8">3: [8]</a>
                above--and NB.: "oneiric" means "of or relating to dreams"). Slothrop then
                meets Thanatz, who
                describes witnessing the "Max Weber charisma" of the rocket, which "the State
                bureaucracy
                could never routinize." (464) Thanatz also remembers a boy he saw at "the
                Heath" (which he
                visited with Margherita and the S/M show): "Gottfried. God's peace, which
                I trust he's found."
                (465; see <a href="#1-14">1: [14]</a> above.) He begins to describe Blicero's breakdown and
                the "last day" (465),
                but he's interrupted by Margherita and Bianca, who go into their own S/M
                act. The crowd is so
                smitten with this act that they form a circle of sorts, held together by
                some pretty complex
                (covalent?) sexual bonding (467; cf. Kekul&eacute;'s benzine ring, 410-13,
                above?). Everybody comes,

                willing. After

                (470) Slothrop agrees;

                        doesn't mean much in Japanese, but cf. Longfellow's poem, "Morituri Salutamus"?:

                        Story" (474-9),
                        which is, however, narrated in the third person. After failing to make it
                        in Hollywood,
                        Margherita returned to Germany. She was becoming convinced that she was
                        part Jewish. She
                        ended up in Bad Karma, with one Sigmund, for the mud cure--this famous mud
                        being "hot and
                        greasy with traces of radium." (475) Morituri, also visiting Bad Karma,
                        learned from Sigmund of
                        Margherita's strange absences; curious, he took to following her. One night
                        he discovered she
                        had been murdering Jewish children ("Little piece of Jewish shit. Don't
                        try to run away from

                        did not report
                        Margherita to the police. Next day, Margherita and Sigmund left Bad Karma.

                        His story over, Morituri tells of his longing to return to his home and
                        family, when the Pacific
                        war is over, "never to leave Hiroshima again" (480; cf. 693, below). Slothrop

                "Something was being planned, it involved the boy Gottfried." She left the
                firing battery with
                Blicero, who called her (natch) "Katje," for a building she agreed to call
                the "Castle," where she
                watched a meeting at a distance, including something gray, plastic--which,
                she was told, was for
                the "F-Ger&auml;t . . . or some letter." Dressed in an outfit of Imipolex,
                open at the crotch, and tied
                down, she submitted to one Drohne, wearing "a gigantic Imipolex penis over
                his own." She
                awoke much later, outside, naked and alone. The battery was abandoned, but
                something had
                happened there.

                        [21] 519-525. Enzian and two Herero subordinates, Andreas and Christian,
                        burst into an
                        abandoned room. They are too late; Christian's sister, Maria, has already
                        been abducted by
                Joseph Ombindi and the Empty Ones (see <a href="#3-3">3: [3]</a> above), for an enforced abortion.
                As Enzian
                and his cohorts head for the (Jamf) refinery on motorcycles, Enzian begins
                to see the bombing of
                factories not as random destruction but as deliberate
                <i>modification</i>--"part of a plan both sides--'<i>sides</i>?'--had
                always agreed on." (520) The true War, he now speculates, was "dictated
                . . . by the
                needs of technology." (521; cf. 105, above?) Another song, "Just a daredevil
                Desox-yephedine
                Daddy" (522) At the refinery the motorcycle trio finds Pavel, Maria's husband,
                hallucinating,
                high from sniffing Leunagasolin. Again, Enzian thinks of his mission: to
                find the center
                (whether rocket, refinery, Volkswagen factory), the "true text." He fantasizes
                an address to all
                the assembled Erdschweinh&ouml;hle (see <a href="1-3">1: [3]</a> above): "<i>My people,
                    I have had a vision</i>" (525; cf.
                M.L. King, Jr.?). "Somewhere," he thinks, formulating the ideology of his
                "new Search," ". . . is
                the key that will bring us back, restore us to our Earth and to our freedom."
                (525) From Pavel,
                finally, the three Hereros get the address of "Ombindi's medical connection."

                        G&ouml;ll for abandoning
                N&auml;rrisch: "Springer, this ain't the fuckin' <i>movies </i>now, come
                on." "Not yet," von G&ouml;ll replies,
                and the narrative turns, briefly, into basic travelogue. In spite of his
                anger at the betrayal of
                N&auml;rrisch, Slothrop makes another deal with von G&ouml;ll: he will pick
                up a package von G&ouml;ll is after
                in return for discharge papers, to be delivered at Cuxhaven. They approach,
                ram, and board the
                <i>Anubis </i>(the package is on board). Slothrop is dispatched to the
                suddenly darkened engineroom,
                where he is attacked, and then bumps into "something hanging from the overhead.
                Icy little
                thighs in wet silk swing against his face. . . . and the smell of . . .
                <i>of</i> . . ." (531; cf. 285, above?).
                When the lights come on he finds the package; but he does not look up. At
                Stralsund he leaves
                the boat, urging von G&ouml;ll to get the papers to Cuxhaven soon.

                        [23] 532-536. We cut to "The White Visitation." Brigadier Pudding died
                        in June, of a massive
                <i>E. Coli </i>infection (contracted, presumably, during his sessions with
                Katje/Domina Nocturna--see
                <a href="#2-4">2: [4]</a> above). Left alone, Katje finds the film that was shot of her, secretly,
                at Pirate's (see 1:
                [14] above--and cf. Katje, here, to Margherita Erdmann). She then screens
                a film of the octopus,
                Grigori, watching and responding to the <i>first</i> film (cf. Grigori,
                here, to Franz P&ouml;kler responding
                to <i>Alpdr&uuml;cken</i>?--see <a href="#3-11">3: [11]</a> above). Spliced to the end of
                this is a film of Osbie Feel, narrating
                into the camera the scenario of <i>his</i> film, "Doper's Greed" (534-5;
                is this, perhaps, a model of the
                narrative technique of the book we're reading?). Katje interprets "Doper's
                Greed" as an
                allegorical prophecy (as <i>we</i>, perhaps, are to interpret <i>Gravity's
                    Rainbow</i>?) of Pointsman's fall.
                She leaves "The White Visitation" (cf. her departure from Blicero's Hansel
                and Gretel "game"?).
                Once again, she goes to Pirate's maisonette. Osbie is there, shooting up;
                Katje learns that they
                are getting organized, to work against Pointsman. "Dialectically, sooner
                or later, some
                counterforce would have had to arise." (536; NB. title of Part 4.)

                <i>continuation </i>of the dream that
                opens the book?) of arriving, as a "novice," at a kind of Guilt-Convention.
                Father Rapier
                discourses on Death and Them, on the hope "that some chance of renewal, some
                dialectic, is still
                operating in History." (540) It is a Purgatory (or maybe an Inferno) of
                former employees of the
                Firm, employees who have repented or "turned." (NB. to "turn" an agent,
                technically, means to
                convert him or her into a counter-agent, one who will then betray, covertly,
                his or her former
                "side." But cf. all the talk here about "turning"--e.g., "turn again" [544]--to
                T.S. Eliot's "Ash
                Wednesday"?) Pirate meets, among others, Sir Stephen Dodson-Truck
                (see <a href="#2-3">2: [3]</a> above). He
                then comes to recognize that there can be, for him, no mercy, that he is
                doomed "to stay down
                among the Preterite, . . .impossible to locate or to redeem." (544) Katje
                arrives. There is debate
                about the guilt of Frans van der Groov (545; see <a href="#1-14">1: [14]</a> above). "But the
                People will never love
                you," she says to Pirate, who is holding her, "or me. . . . Do you know where
                that puts us?" (548)
                They begin to dance, as do the others around them, dissolving "into the race
                and swarm of this
                dancing Preterition." (548)

                above), is now walking
                alone in the Zone. "The Nationalities are on the move." The potato fields
                have been stripped by
                the SS, to make alcohol for the rockets. Slothrop dreams about Tantivy (551-2).
                He is becoming
                sensitive to the presence of animals, trees--which his family made money
                cutting down, for
                paper. "That's really insane," Slothrop says to himself (553). We are given
                his "Partial List of
                Wishes on Evening Stars for This Period " (cf. 760, below?), and we learn
                of his meeting with a
                fat kid, Ludwig, who's looking for his lost lemming, Ursula (553; cf. the
                racial suicide program
                of the Empty Ones?). Slothrop reassures Ludwig (cf. <a href="#3-10">3: [10]</a> above?) and
                joins him in his
                search. As they look for Ursula, Slothrop thinks about his "first American
                ancestor William," a
                dissenter from "the Wintrop machine" (cf. Amy Sprue, 329, above?). William
                fled from Boston
                to the Berkshires, where he raised pigs (cf. <a href="#3-28">3: [28]</a> below?) with his son
                John. (NB. Nathaniel
                Hawthorne's first American ancestor was also named William, and also had
                a son named John.
                Is it relevant that the family whose history provides the subject of Hawthorne's
                <i>House of the Seven Gables </i>is named "Pyncheon"?) William also wrote
                a theological
                treatise, burned in
                Boston, entitled <i>On Preterition</i>--which argued for the importance
                of "the Preterite, the many God
                passes over when he chooses a few for salvation . . . without whom there'd
                be no elect." (555)
                Because of orthodox hostility to this work, he moved back to England. "Could
                he have been the
                fork in the road America never took, the singular point she jumped the wrong
                way from? . . . It
                seems to Tyrone Slothrop that there might be a route back" (556; cf. Enzian,
                525, above?), <i>via </i>the temporary anarchy of the Zone. Slothrop gets
                separated from Ludwig in
                a town near the sea,
                when they chance upon--of all people--Major Duane Marvy, warming himself
                in front of a fire
                (see <a href="#3-1">3: [1]</a> <a href="#3-2">[2]</a> and <a href="#3-4">[4]</a> above).

                        black market activities
                        in the Russian zone--does not recognize Slothrop. With Marvy is Clayton
                        ("Bloody") Chiclitz (a
                magnate, later in his career, in <i>V. </i>and <i>The Crying of Lot 49</i>),
                at this point into the black market,
                and manufacturer of such curious toys as "Juicy Jap" and "Shufflin' Sam."
                After declining a taste
                of Marvy's "Atomic Chile," Slothrop accompanies them on a visit to a rocket
                site, where he
                learns of their plan (with Tchitcherine) to raid a nearby Schwarzkommando
                camp at midnight.
                He sets out to find and warn the Schwarzkommando; he is also losing his ability

                Schwarzger&auml;t quest. At the camp he meets Andreas (Enzian is absent)
                and delivers his warning.
                He also tells Andreas what he learned about the Schwarzger&auml;t from Thanatz
                and Margherita. Andreas explains the Herero mandala, and the relation of
                the Hereros' being "passed over" to their
                quest for the Rocket.

                        Schwarzkommando camp,
                        only to find it empty. He recalls what he learned from interrogating
                        N&auml;rrisch (who was not killed
                        after all). There was a special oxygen hook-up, from which Tchitcherine
                        concludes that the
                        "Schwarzger&auml;t" was some sort of after-burner. He's also worried about

                        officer" Marvy met (i.e., Slothrop, in Tchitcherine's uniform); do his superiors
                        know about his

                        lead the narrator (apparently) to a meditation on "film and calculus, both
                        pornographies of flight.
                        Reminders of impotence and abstraction." (567) As he approaches a village,
                        children tell
                        Slothrop the legend of "Plechazunga, the Pig-Hero," who held off a Viking
                        invasion in the tenth
                        century. They ask him to take the part of the hero in their annual festival.
                        This he does, next
                        day, dressed in a pig suit. Later, the police brutally break up the village's

                        which he confuses with memories of his film-actor idol, Rudolf Klein-Rogge.
                        Central to the
                        appeal of both are fantasies of brutally transcendent power. Klein-Rogge
                        played Dr. Mabuse (a

                the charismatic flash."
                (579) P&ouml;kler recalls Jamf's last lecture: "move beyond life toward
                the inorganic." (580) But
                Jamf himself stayed with carbon, and moved to America, "under the sinister

                        His business
                        downfall began when he befriended Alfonso Tracy, Princeton '06, who had been

                        Temple at Mouthorgan, Mo., to see the machines, Bland then calls in his German
                        "expert," Bert

                        they gave him membership out of gratitude. We then learn something of the
                        history of the
                        Masons, as a conspiratorial force behind much of American History (587-8).
                        They have now lost
                        touch with their former magic, becoming simply a businessman's club, but
                        Bland gets in touch
                        with the old magic. He learns to leave his body. He took to leaving it
                        for longer and longer
                        periods. Getting into it he finds "that Gravity, taken so for granted, is
                        really something eerie,
                        Messianic, extrasensory in Earth's mindbody" (590; his mysticism is compared
                        to that reported
                by the late Walter Rathenau to Carroll Eventyr--see <a href="#1-19">1: [19]</a> above). Finally
                he announced to his
                family: "Tonight, I am going out for good." And he did.

                        [31] 591-610. Doctors Muffage and Spontoon are in Cuxhaven. They're
                        working for
                Pointsman--who, Muffage thinks, is "<i>losing his grip</i>." And they're
                looking for Slothrop--who,
                they learn from a British corporal, is in town, wearing a pig suit. At an
                alcohol dump, the fuel
                now fuelling a party, Seaman Bodine (see <a href="#3-6">3: [6]</a> and <a href="#3-8">[8]</a> above)
                is promoting a runciple spoon
                fight. Slothrop's nearby, in a trailer, still wearing his pig suit. As
                the police close in he escapes
                with one Albert Krypton. They find Bodine who--the runciple spoon fight
                over--flees with them,
                the MP's (and Muffage and Spontoon) in hot pursuit. They hijack a Red Cross
                canteen truck,
                which takes them to a bar-casino-opium den-whorehouse, "Putzi's," where Slothrop
                hopes to
                meet up with Der Springer. Bodine introduces Slothrop to a whore named
                "Solange," who offers
                to take him to the baths. She explains to a by now very paranoid Slothrop
                that the Zone is not
                one Plot but, as he reflects, "a network of all plots," which "may yet carry
                him to freedom." (603)
                As they head for the baths Bodine goes off to make a cocaine delivery--to,
                as it turns out, Major
                Marvy. Marvy then gets set up with a Spanish whore (a victim of Franco),
                Manuela, who hangs
                his uniform in a closet and leads him to the baths. An MP raid is suddenly
                announced; Marvy,
                fleeing, finds only Slothrop's pig costume in the changing room. He puts
                it on, and is then
                captured. He is taken off in an ambulance, in which Muffage and
                Spontoon--thinking he's
                Slothrop--remove his testicles, for Pointsman. Marvy, too, as "Slothrop,"
                is to be taken back to
                Pointsman.
            </p>
                    <p>
                        Meanwhile, back at Putzi's, Slothrop is asleep in bed with Solange, dreaming
                        of Zw&ouml;lfkinder and
                        Bianca. "Solange," who is in fact Leni P&ouml;kler, is also dreaming--of
                <i>her </i>Bianca, Ilse. "Leni's
                early dream for her is coming true. She will not be used." (610) Upstairs,
                one M&ouml;llner explains
                to Bodine that von G&ouml;ll is very busy; there are, in any case, no papers
                (the discharge von G&ouml;ll
                promised to Slothrop--see <a href="#3-22">3: [22]</a> above) for the sailor's friend.

                        [32] 610-616. Tchitcherine has traced Weissmann's rocket battery to
                        the L&uuml;neberg Heath; but
                what he has found there is the set of <i>Martin Fierro </i>(see <a href="#3-8">3: [8]</a>
                above), which he's never read.
                But the singing-duel is now being filmed, and he recognizes its similarity
                to the one he saw in
                Central Asia, on the way to the Kirghiz Light. He knows that Weissmann in
                fact fired the 00000
                rocket nearby. But now he must wait; "there is a counterforce," he believes,
                "in the Zone." He
                hopes he might meet Enzian here. Felipe--one of the Argentine anarchists
                involved in the
                filming of <i>Martin Fierro</i>--meditates (in the cinematic terms that
                have become popular in the
                group) on the true nature of history (612-13). This set, we learn, will
                remain as a permanent
                village. And we learn about new, strange villages springing up in the Zone,
                including the Hund-Stadt, populated by trained killer-dogs who, since their
                masters have died or disappeared, cannot
                be pacified. A study on how to induce factionalism (master-cults) among
                these dogs, in order to
                facilitate the re-taking of the village, has been contracted to Pointsman.
                He is now in official
                disgrace, since the castrating of Marvy. Clive Mossmoon (see <a href="#1-5">1: [5]</a> and
                <a href="#2-14">2: [4]</a> above) and Sir
                Marcus Scammony discuss what is to be done about Pointsman--and about "the
                American" (i.e.,
                Slothrop). Sir Marcus's "idle and bitchy faggotry" is contrasted with the
                loving homosexuality of
                the World War I battlefields (cf. Pudding's memories, <a href="#2-14">2: [4]</a> above?).
                "Homosexuality in high
                places is just a carnal afterthought now, and the real and only fucking is

                        [1] 619-626. Bette Davis, Margaret Dumont and Tyrone Slothrop (waking)
                        hear the overhead
                passage of a P-47 Thunderbolt ("it <i>sounds </i>. . . like a kazoo"),
                piloted by Pirate Prentice. Others
                (Osbie Feel, Webley Silvernail, Katje) are also on Slothrop's trail. Since
                V-E day Pirate has lost
                "his odd talent for living the fantasies of others," but he's still "haunted"
                by Frans van der Groov
                (see <a href="#1-14">1: [14]</a> above). Beneath him, Gustav and S&auml;ure Bummer
                (see <a href="#3-12">3: [12]</a> above) are still
                arguing about Beethoven vs. Rossini (621-2). Slothrop, elsewhere in the
                Zone, finds his
                harmonica, soaking in a stream--the same harmonica, in fact, that he lost
                at the Roseland
                Ballroom in 1938 or 1939 (see <a href="#1-10">1 [10]</a> above); but he doesn't remember. "Yup,
                still thinking
                there's a way to get back . . . America. Poor asshole, he can't let her
                go." (630) Eventually,
                wandering, drawing diagrams of the rocket as graffiti, "he becomes a cross
                himself, a
                crossroads." (625) He dreams of a dog, killed by the noise (cf. the rocket?)
                as he retrieves a
                mandrake-root for a magician (cf. Pointsman?). Then (as it will be put later)
                he is "dispersed";
                he "sees a very thick rainbow here, a stout rainbow cock driven down out
                of pubic clouds into
                Earth [cf. 693, below?] green wet valleyed Earth, and his chest fills and
                he stands crying, not a
                thing in his head, just feeling natural." (626)

                        [2] 626-640. Roger Mexico (been a long time, hasn't it?) is driving
                        on the Autobahn. He recalls
                        Jessica's last visit to "The White Visitation," his own need (which, however,
                        wanes at times) to
                        do "what's right" about Slothrop--whom Jessica regards mainly as a monster.
                        The war over,
                        Jessica was leaving--and left, to go to Cuxhaven, with Beaver
                (see <a href="#1-16">1: [16]</a>
                above). Milton
                Gloaming (see <a href="#1-5">1: [5]</a> above), back from the Zone, filled Roger in on "the
                great struggle for the
                IG's intelligence machinery" (630), to which Slothrop seemed quite important.
                Mexico arrives
                (still a flashback here, but now in the present tense) at Twelfth House,
                to confront Pointsman.
                Geza R&oacute;zsav&ouml;gli (a "White Visitation" veteran) is there, in the
                reception room; backed into
                Pointsman's "shadow-corner," he enters a bizarre Hawaii fantasy (634-5; a
                Slothropian
                "appearance"?--note the language, and cf. Slothrop's shirt, <a href="#2-1">2: [1]</a> above?).
                Mexico finds
                Pointsman in the office of Clive Mossmoon (see <a href="#1-4">1: [5]</a> and
                <a href="#2-4">2: [4]</a> above), where
                a meeting is in
                progress. He leaps on the conference table, and pisses all over the assembled
                elite--except
                Pointsman, whom he curses, elaborately. Then, after escaping, he goes to
                Pirate's, to be told
                about "Creative Paranoia," the need to combat the "They-system" with a
                "We-system." "Well,"
                replies Roger, "you're playing Their game, then." (638) Sir Stephen Dodson-Truck
                is there (see
                <a href="#2-3">2: [3]</a> and <a href="#3-24">3: [24]</a> above); we learn about the fate of his wife, Nora
                (see <a href="#1-18">1: [18]</a> above): she has
                identified with Gravity, and become victim to practical jokes from her friends.
                (639) Thomas
                Gwenhidwy (see <a href="#1-17">1: [17]</a> and <a href="#1-20">1: [20]</a> above) is also there.
                And in spite of his doubts, Roger joins
                them. Which is why (back to this chapter's opening "present") Roger is on
                the Autobahn, driving into Cuxhaven.

                        [3] 640-655. In Thuringia, at night, Pfc. Eddie Pensiero, "amphetimine
                        enthusiast" and expert
                        reader of shivers, is giving a haircut to his colonel. An overhead bulb
                        is kept lighted by a hand
                        generator, cranked by Paddy ("Electro") McGonigle, an expert reader of strobing
                        frequencies.
                        They hear somebody "playing blues on a mouth harp" in the dark (624; another
                        Slothropian
                "appearance"?). The colonel is from Kenosha, Wisconsin (cf. <a href="#1-10">1: [10]</a> above?).
                We shift (in the
                colonel's fantasy) to a dialogue between "Skippy" and "Mister Information"--about
                "Happyville,"
                the "pointsman," the persistence of the War in which, still, "the right people
                are dying." (644-46)
                Then "Skippy" (turning back, more or less, into the colonel) meets Dr. Jamf.
                Then we learn that
                the bulb run by Paddy's generator is the <i>same </i>bulb that Franz
                P&ouml;kler slept under at Nordhausen
                (see 426-7, above): "This bulb is <i>immortal</i>"! Which brings us to
                "The Story of Byron the Bulb"
                (647-55), told to "Skippy" by "Mister Information." Byron's early dreams
                of power set him
                against "Phoebus"--the agency of the international light-bulb cartel which
                "fixes the prices and
                determines the operational lives of all the bulbs in the world." After 1000
                hours, with a Phoebus
                hit-woman on her way to get him, Byron is bulb-snatched, and dispatched on
                a series of travels
                too bizarre to detail here. We learn, meanwhile, about the working arrangements
                between
                Phoebus and "The Grid." (654) Byron survives, but his early ambition has
                been thwarted; he "is
                condemned to go on forever, knowing the truth and powerless to change anything."
                (655; cf.
                Pirate's hopes for "Creative Paranoia," <a href="#4-2">4: [2]</a> above?) The story over,
                Lazslo Jamf ("Mr.
                Information"?) walks away; "the colonel is left alone in Happyville." Then,
                his throat is wholly
                exposed to Eddie's razor, to the strobing of the bulb.

                        [4] 656-663. Katje, in a white tennis dress, on a stolen bicycle, meets
                        the Hereros, in white
                        sailor suits, singing "Pa-ra-noooiia" (657; "ooooi"?). She was not ready
                        for the "blackness." She
                        meets, for the first time, Enzian, who talks to her about the "Raketen-Stadt"
                (660; cf. <a href="#4-6">4: [6]</a>
                below?), and about Weissmann: "Whatever happened at the end, he has
                transcended." (660-61)
                He recalls what Weissmann, in a letter, said about Katje (662). He tells
                her the Hereros have
                someone "who was with Blicero in May" (this being, we learn in the next chapter,
                Thanatz--see

                fell off the <i>Anubis </i>in
                the same storm that sent Slothrop overboard (see <a href="#3-18">3: [18]</a> above). He was
                rescued by a Polish
                undertaker, trying (in order to make him better in his particular line of
                work) to get struck by
                lightning--seeking to "experience a singular point." After setting Thanatz
                ashore, he gets his
                wish (664-65). Thanatz then encounters a village of male homosexuals, liberated
                (or, as they see
                it, "banished") from Dora (see <a href="#3-11">3: [11]</a> above). They have reproduced, in
                their "freedom," a
                "phantom SS command," modelled on their fantasy of the Rocket-structure at
                the Mittelwerke.
                They are waiting for Blicero, of whom they've only heard, to be their leader.
                Thanatz has come
                to be haunted by his memories of Blicero (see <a href="#3-14">3: [14]</a> above). He seeks
                him out, however, at a
                nearby gasworks--recalling, meanwhile, Peter Sachsa's prewar s&eacute;ances
                (668; see <a href="#1-5">1: [5]</a> <a href="#1-18">[18]</a> and
                <a href="#1-19">[19]</a> above). Thanatz is nabbed by the Russians, then freed (by mistake)
                by Polish guerillas. So
                begin his "lessons in being preterite" (668). He travels the Zone as a DP.
                His memory of the last
                rocket-firing grows clearer--which he is now (i.e., in the "present" of the
                close of the previous
                chapter) relating to the Schwarzkommando. He's coming to see that "the two
                children, Gottfried
                and Bianca, <i>are the same</i>." (672) Telling all he remembers to the
                assembled Erdschweinh&ouml;hlers,
                "he is the angel they've hoped for." They have already assembled their own
                rocket from
                scavenged fragments (cf. Mexico to Pointsman, 88, above?). And by the time
                he's done "they
                will all know what the Schwarzger&auml;t was, how it was used, where the
                00000 was fired from, and
                which way it was pointed." (673) All this brings the various Herero factions
                together, reconciles
                them. Maria has even appeared in a dream to Christian (see <a href="#3-21">3: [21]</a> above),
                saying she seeks no
                revenge on Ombindi.

                        [6] 674-700. (This long, bizarre chapter may give us [see, for instance,
                        682, below] what's left
                        of Slothrop's "point of view," since his "dispersal.") We are in the
                        Raketen-Stadt, "where the
                <i>Father </i>["Broderick"--see <a href="#3-1">3: [1]</a> above] plots constantly to kill
                his son." Tyrone sets out to
                rescue the "Radiant Hour," stolen from the day's 24 by "colleagues of the
                Father, for sinister
                reasons of their own." (674) The "Floundering Four"--Tyrone, Myrtle Miraculous
                (she can
                perform miracles), Maximillian ("a Negro in a pearl-gray zoot suit and Inverness
                cape"), and
                Marcel ("a mechanical chess-player") set out to combat the "Paternal Peril."
                Each has a flaw (cf.
                Dorothy's three companions in <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>?). Song, "How-dy
                neighbor, how-dy pard!"
                (677; cf. various details to 760, below?) They gradually infiltrate their
                own audience (or
                someone else's). Maximillian is reading "the Closet Intellectual Book, <i>The
                    Wisdom of the Great Kamikaze Pilots</i>, with illustrations by Walt Disney."
                Then, as parts
                of the "nonstop revue,"
                watched by the now-infiltrated-audience, various sketches. "The Low Frequency
                Listener" (681-2): Slothrop, for reasons he can't remember, is trying to
                get through to the Argentine anarchists.
                He's at Magdeburg, site of a low-frequency antenna. He's having trouble
                remembering his
                parents, "as Broderick progresses into Perilous Pop and Nalline into ssshhhghh
                . . ." (682) Next
                (in the "revue"), "Mom Slothrop's Letter to Ambassador Kennedy" (682): she
                asks, familiarly
                and drunkenly, for news of Tyrone. Then, "On the Phrase 'Ass Backwards'"
                (683-87): S&auml;ure
                Bummer, talking to Slothrop, attacks the illogic of this phrase. We learn
                about the umlaut-deficient robbery victim (female) who, meaning to shout
                "H&uuml;bsch R&auml;uber ("cute-looking
                robber"), instead came out with "Hubschrauber" ("helicopter," which had not
                yet been invented)
                (683-4). Seaman Bodine, after defending "Ass Backwards," sings "My Doper's
                Cadenza" (685-6). Then (still the "revue"), "Shit 'n' Shinola" (687-8):
                their color is contrasted with the white of
                toilets--"Odorless and Official Death." Next, "An Incident in the Transvestites'
                Toilet" (688-90):
                Slothrop's dressed in drag, as Fay Wray. An ape hands him a sodium bomb,
                which explodes
                when flushed down the toilet by an Asian--also in drag, as Margaret O'Brien.
                Next, "A Moment
                of Fun with Takeshi and Ichizo, the Komical Kamikazes" (690-92): they keep
                learning from "old
                Kenosha (cf. <a href="#1-10">1: [10]</a> and <a href="#4-3">4: [3]</a> above?)
                the loony radarman" that no American targets are within
                range. Then, "Streets" (692-94): Slothrop finds (he doesn't know where)
                a newspaper fragment--"a wirephoto of a giant white cock, dangling in the
                sky downward out of a white pubic bush" (cf.
                626, above?) under a partial headline: "MB DRO / ROSHI (cf. 480, above?
                But NB., also,
                "Roshi" is the title of the highest Zen master.) Then, "Listening to the
                Toilet" (694-97): on
                waiting to hear the sound of the toilet shut off (by Them), waiting for brief
                cessations of "the
                roaring of the sun," in towns which turn out to be "on the borders of <i>Time
                    Zones</i>"--was it
                "Kenosha, Wisconsin?" (696)--where the Kenosha Kid is caught in a "sound-shadow"
                (cf. <a href="#4-2">4: [2]</a>
                above?). Then, "Witty Repartee" (697-98): more of Ichizo and Takeshi, then
                some information
                on the Hotchkiss machine gun. Then, "Heart-to-Heart, Man-to-Man" (698-99):
                "Pop" and
                "Tyrone" discuss the latter's growing "electrofreak" addiction to "screwing
                in," "waves." Next
                (and last), "Some Characteristics of Imipolex G" (699-700): "the first plastic
                that is actually
                <i>erectile</i>." (Hmmmmm?) Various theories about the necessary stimulus:
                "a thin matrix of
                wires," "a beam-scanning system . . . analogous to the well-known video electron
                stream," or
                projection of an "electronic 'image,' analogous to a motion picture."

                        [7] 700-706. Tchitcherine is alone now; Soviet intelligence officer,
                        Nicolai (yes) Ripov, is
                closing in. Tchitcherine remembers what Wimpe (see, for instance, <a href="#3-5">3: [5]</a>
                above) once said to
                him: "Marxist dialectic s? That's <i>not </i>an opiate, eh?" (701) The
                peculiarity of Oneirine:
                "P&ouml;kler's singularity" (702)--a "haunting," dull and difficult to
                distinguish from reality, but
                leading to "the discovery that <i>everything is connected</i>" (703).
                Then comes "Tchitcherine's
                Haunting," an interrogation by Ripov. "Why were you hunting your black brother?"
                "I thought,"
                Tchitcherine replies, "I was being punished. Passed over. I blamed him."
                (705) He then learns
                his future from Ripov: a 30-days' leave, then back to Russia, then to Central
                Asia with captured
                German rocket personnel.

                        it was held): Ensign
                Morituri (see <a href="#3-16">3: [16]</a> above), Carroll Eventyr
                (see <a href="#1-5">1: [5]</a> and <a href="#1-18">[18]</a> above),
                Thomas Gwenhidwy
                (see <a href="#1-20">1: [20]</a> above), and Roger Mexico. They deduce the firing
                <i>direction </i>of the 00000 rocket--true north; but where was it fired
                <i>from</i>? Roger recalls (another flashback shifting into present
                tense) Jessica telling him, in Cuxhaven, of her decision to marry Jeremy.
                Jeremy, at lunch,
                invites him to dinner, at the home of a former Krupp manager, Stefan
                Utgarthaloki. Roger brings
                along Seaman Bodine, who's wearing an extraordinary zoot suit (cf. <a href="#2-6">2: [6]</a>),
                above?). Arriving,
                they notice four musicians--including Gustav and Anton (see <a href="#3-12">3: [12]</a>
                above)--scheduled to play
                Haydn's suppressed "Kazoo" quartet (711-12). Slothrop, we learn, "has become
                one plucked
                albatross. Plucked, hell--<i>stripped</i>. Scattered, all over the Zone.
                It's doubtful if he can ever be
                'found' again, in the conventional sense of 'positively identified and
                detained.'" (712) We learn
                about the Counterforce's abiding awe of "the man"--who "has a branch office
                in each of our
                brains." (712) At table, seeing a huge barbecue pit at the end of the dining
                room, and realizing
                that they themselves are to be the "&Uuml;berrashungbraten" ("surprise roast"),
                Roger and Bodine
                proceed to gross out the other guests by inventing disgusting, alliterative
                menu entries (e.g.,
                "<i>menstrual marmalade</i>," "<i>clot casserole</i>"). "Commando Connie"
                Flamp, war correspondent,
                joins the game ("<i>discharge dumplings</i>"), as do the musicians ("wart
                waffles," "puke pancakes,
                with sweat syrup"). The others begin to vomit uncontrollably. Jessica leaves
                with Jeremy.
                "Does Roger have a second of pain right here? Yes. Sure. You would too."
                (716) Then Bodine
                and Roger, followed by the musicians, escape--as Connie continues the game
                alone.

                is looking for Tchitcherine; she's "the

                ways of "returning,"
                which Europe refused, establishing instead "its order of Analysis and Death."
                "In time," he
                explains, "the death-colonies grew strong enough to break away [cf.

                impulse to empire, the mission to propagate death, the structure of it, kept

                        to see him at all, "to
                hold him together, even as a concept": "<i>Rocketman, Rocketman</i>.
                <i>You poor fucker</i>." (740-41) He
                gives Slothrop a piece of a shirt soaked in the blood of John Dillinger,
                outside the Biograph
                Theater (see 368, 516, above; and cf. the cloth with which St. Veronica [see,
                for instance, <a href="#1-7">1: [7]</a>
                above] wiped Christ's face?). Later, Bodine began, "helpless, in shame,
                to let Slothrop go." We
                learn of Slothrop's last appearance--on the cover of the only album released

                <i>wine</i>--defying gravity with a
                "wine rush" (743). Which, apparently, sets off the series of titled sub-chapters
                that conclude the
                book: "The Occupation of Mingeborough" (744): back in Massachusetts, a
                memory which is
                also a look into the future; "it may be too late to get home." "Back in
                Der Platz" (745-6): at
                S&auml;ure's, Gustav and Anton have converted kazoos into hashish pipes;
                Gustav screws a light bulb
                into his--turns out to be our friend, Byron. We're told about "the movie
                under the rug," in which
                various irreversible processes are reversed. "Weissmann's Tarot" (746-49):
                "He is the father you
                will never quite manage to kill. The Oedipal situation in the Zone these
                days is terrible" (747).
                Weissmann's present condition is set forth by the Tower, over whose significance
                there is considerable debate. Others of his cards are analyzed. "The Last
                Green and Magenta" (749): on the
                Heath. "The Horse" (749): the last horse in waiting to be sacrificed (cf.
                337, above?). "Isaac"
                (749-50): at the moment he was about to be sacrificed by his father, Abraham,
                Isaac saw the
                antechambers of the Throne.

                        "Pre-Launch" (750-51): Weissmann has bound and dressed the boy prettily,
                        before placing him
                        in the Rocket; "the 00000 is the womb into which Gottfried returns." (750;
                        i.e., we are now
                        learning directly what happened on "the Heath"). The Rocket is the Oven
                (see <a href="#1-14">1: [14]</a> above).
                And Gottfried himself is the "Schwarzger&auml;t." "Hardware" (751): Gottfried
                is encased in
                Imipolex. There is an earphone for communications from Weissmann, but there
                is no return
                channel. "Chase Music" (751-53): various aging super-heroes (e.g., Superman,
                The Lone
                Ranger, Philip Marlowe) begin arriving "too late." "He [i.e., Pointsman]
                actually misses the
                dogs." He has missed his chance. "He'll be left only with Cause and Effect,
                and the rest of his
                sterile armamentarium . . . his mineral corridors do not shine." "Countdown"
                (753-54): the
                rocket countdown was actually first invented for a movie, <i>Die Frau in
                    Mond </i>(1929; cf. Ilse's
                dreams, <a href="#3-11">3: [11]</a> above?) by Fritz Lang. It is interpreted by "Kabbalist
                spokesman Steve
                Edelman:" it "appears to be serial, [but] it actually conceals the Tree of
                Life, which must be
                apprehended all at once, together, in parallel" (cf. Leni P&ouml;kler to
                Franz, 159, above?).

                    <p>
                        "Strung Into the Apollonian Dream" (754): Gottfried waits in the Rocket,
                        gazing at his Imipolex
                        shroud, lulled by the familiar smell. "Come, wake," it says. "All is well."
                        "Orpheus puts Down
                        Harp" (754-57): Richard M. Zhlubb (cf. the source of the epigraph to Part
                        4?), manager of the
                        Orpheus Theater, Los Angeles, complains to "our" reporter about harmonica-playing
                        in movie
                        lines. Steve Edelman is one of the principal trouble-makers. Zhlubb takes
                        our reporter for a
                        drive in his black Volkswagen, with its special laugh-track cassette system.
                        They pass a funeral
                        (JFK? RFK?). Zhlubb has a fantasy of being smothered, while driving, by
                        a dry-cleaning bag: "a
                        plastic shroud." They hear a siren, but "the sound is greater than police."
                        (cf. the opening of
                <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i>?) "The Clearing" (757-58): the Rocket is launched.
                "Ascent" (758-60):
                Gottfried, in the rocket, moves past Brenschluss, rushes into growing whiteness.
                "Descent"
                (760): in the Orpheus Theater the screen has just gone blank. The rocket
                is poised, in its last
                delta-t above the roof of the theater. For our last moment's diversion we
                are offered a hymn,
                written by William Slothrop. "Now everybody--."

                    [This guide was originally created around 1980,
            when I assigned <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i> as the final reading (on which a
            final paper was required) in a Williams College course called "Images of
            History in American Literature"--and then recognized that I'd better do more
            than I'd planned to help my students actually get through the book! &nbsp;The
            guide seemed to provide the help they needed and, circulating in photocopy
            form,
            seems to have helped many others since. &nbsp;I hope that now, via HTML and
            the World Wide Web, it will provide help, and maybe some random amusement,
            to a wider audience. -- MDB]
